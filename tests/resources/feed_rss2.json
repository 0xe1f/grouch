The move comes despite significant uncertainty regarding just how effective this treatment is, and comes just days after Trump attacked the FDA for delaying its work as part of a plot to sabotage his re-election.</p>\n<h2>In the blood</h2>\n<p>Plasma is the liquid portion of the blood, which (among other things) contains antibodies. It has been used to treat other infections, as some antibodies can be capable of neutralizing the infecting pathogen\u2014binding to the bacteria or virus in a way that prevents it from entering cells. Early studies have indicated that it's relatively common for those who have had a SARS-CoV-2 infection to generate antibodies that can neutralize the virus in lab tests, although the antibody response to the virus is also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/06/antibody-testing-suggests-immune-response-post-covid-is-very-variable/\">highly variable</a>.</p>\n<p>In the absence of any effective treatments, people started testing this \"convalescent plasma\" <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/hospitals-in-nyc-will-start-testing-therapy-using-plasma-of-those-infected/\">as early as March</a>, and testing has been expanded as the pool of post-infected individuals has continued to grow. But so far, the evidence has been mixed. One of the largest studies, led by researchers at the Mayo Clinic and including over 35,000 patients, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.12.20169359\">did see an effect</a>, but it was a very mild one: mortality dropped from 11.9 percent in people who received plasma four days or more after starting treatment, compared with 8.7 percent if treatment was started earlier than that. But, critically, the study lacked a control group, leaving its authors talking about \"signatures of efficacy,\" rather than actual evidence of efficacy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1700815#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1700815&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=P614tPda1Eo:cpKHHEXnQ5w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=P614tPda1Eo:cpKHHEXnQ5w:V_sGLiPBpWU\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=P614tPda1Eo:cpKHHEXnQ5w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=P614tPda1Eo:cpKHHEXnQ5w:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=P614tPda1Eo:cpKHHEXnQ5w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=P614tPda1Eo:cpKHHEXnQ5w:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a>\n</div></div>",

With little more than a plastic contraption that looks a bit like a Boggle set and an accompanying web app to scan the resulting dice roll, DiceKeys creates a highly random, mathematically unguessable key. You can then use that key to derive master passwords for password managers, as the seed to create a U2F key for two-factor authentication, or even as the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-keep-bitcoin-safe-and-secure/\">secret key for cryptocurrency wallets</a>.

Bonus: we get to see a miraculously revived Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) don parachute pants in an attempt to blend with the times, much to the amusement of Gal Gadot's Diana Prince.</p>\n<p>Inspired by the comic book heroine created by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Moulton_Marston\">William Moulton Marston</a> in the 1940s for DC Comics, Wonder Woman made her big-screen debut in the DCEU with 2016's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_v_Superman:_Dawn_of_Justice\"><em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em></a>, followed by 2017's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_(film)\"><em>Justice League</em></a>. As we reported previously, the first fell short of box office expectations; the second bombed outright. So when Jenkins took on Wonder Woman's origin story, she deliberately departed from the grim humorlessness and dark sensibility of those earlier films, bringing a brighter energy and wit to her tale, along with the usual action. That vision paid off: <em>Wonder Woman</em> went on to gross $821 million worldwide and earned critical raves, making it the most successful of the DCEU films thus far. </p>\n<p>Since we're now in the 1980s, Diana is operating in a Cold War scenario, taking on Pedro Pascal's villainous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Lord\">Maxwell Lord</a>, a shrewd and powerful businessman. Wiig plays Barbara Ann Minerva, a British archaeologist who will eventually evolve into her <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah_(comics)#Barbara_Ann_Minerva\">arch-nemesis Cheetah</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1700655#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1700655&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gXUry-hcjtY:PzlSL8YGpZ0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gXUry-hcjtY:PzlSL8YGpZ0:V_sGLiPBpWU\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gXUry-hcjtY:PzlSL8YGpZ0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=gXUry-hcjtY:PzlSL8YGpZ0:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gXUry-hcjtY:PzlSL8YGpZ0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=gXUry-hcjtY:PzlSL8YGpZ0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a>\n</div></div>",

But trawling through data collected before and after the ship set sail, researchers noted that the 18 spared from infection just happened to include the only three people on board that had potent, pre-existing immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, the three sailors were the only ones found to have SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, which are proteins that circulate in the blood and completely sink the infectious virus.</p>\n<p>The numbers are small, and the finding is not definitive.

As we descend past 500 feet, the 15-knot gusts hitting our side and the pilot\u2019s hands still hovering, the wheel and pedals begin to jostle, compensating for the wind with inhuman precision.

Many of those mummified remains have survived but are in such a fragile state that researchers are loath to disturb the remains to learn more about them. Now an inter-disciplinary team of scientists has managed to digitally \"unwrap\" three specimens\u2014a mummified cat, bird, and snake\u2014using a high-resolution 3D X-ray imaging technique, essentially enabling them to conduct a virtual postmortem, according to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69726-0\">a new paper</a> published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>\n<p>Studying fragile ancient artifacts with cutting-edge imaging technology confers a powerful advantage on archaeological analysis. For instance, in 2016, an international team of scientists <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/wondergadget-allows-researchers-to-read-a-charred-bibli-1786824739\">developed a method</a> for \"virtually unrolling\" a badly damaged ancient scroll found on the western shore of the Dead Sea, revealing the first few verses from the book of Leviticus. The so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En-Gedi_Scroll\">En Gedi scroll</a> was recovered from the ark of an ancient synagogue destroyed by fire around 600 CE.</p>\n<p>In 2019, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/08/physicists-discover-hidden-text-in-what-was-thought-to-be-blank-egyptian-papyri/\">we reported</a> that German scientists used a combination of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207418307519?via%3Dihub\">cutting-edge physics techniques</a> to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207419301670?via%3Dihub\">virtually \"unfold\"</a> an ancient Egyptian papyrus, part of an extensive collection housed in the Berlin Egyptian Museum. Their analysis revealed that a seemingly blank patch on the papyrus actually contained characters written in what had become \"invisible ink\" after centuries of exposure to light. And earlier this year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/scientists-discover-that-four-blank-dead-sea-scrolls-actually-have-text/\">we reported</a> that scientists had used multispectral imaging on four supposedly blank Dead Sea Scrolls and found the scrolls contained hidden text, most likely a passage from the book of Ezekiel.  </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1700405#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1700405&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=0dFXZFdAjkk:AN1d7WXpQEU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=0dFXZFdAjkk:AN1d7WXpQEU:V_sGLiPBpWU\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=0dFXZFdAjkk:AN1d7WXpQEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=0dFXZFdAjkk:AN1d7WXpQEU:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=0dFXZFdAjkk:AN1d7WXpQEU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=0dFXZFdAjkk:AN1d7WXpQEU:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a>\n</div></div>",

Like Philip Kaufman's Oscar-winning 1983 film of the same name, the series is based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_Stuff_(book)\">bestselling 1979 book</a> by Tom Wolfe.</p>\n<p>Wolfe became interested in the US space program while on assignment by Rolling Stone to cover the launch of Apollo 17, NASA's last Moon mission. He spent the next seven years writing <em>The Right Stuff</em>, intent on capturing the drive and ethos of those early astronauts. (In a foreword to the 1983 edition, he pondered \"What makes a man willing to sit up on top of an enormous Roman candle... and wait for someone to light the fuse.\")  Wolfe spent a great deal of time consulting with General Chuck Yeager, who was shut out of the astronaut program and ended up as a contrasting character to the college-degreed Project Mercury team featured in the book. <em>The Right Stuff</em> won widespread critical praise, as well as the National Book Award for Nonfiction. </p>\n<p>When United Artists decided to finance <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Right_Stuff_(film)\">a film adaptation</a>, the studio hired <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/rip-william-goldman-creator-of-beloved-film-the-princess-bride/\">William Goldman</a> (<em>The Princess Bride</em>) to adapt the screenplay, but his vision was very different from that of director Philip Kaufman, and Goldman quit the project. Kaufman wrote his own draft script in eight weeks, making Yeager more of a central figure; Goldman's script ignored Yeager entirely. Goldman later wrote that \"Phil [Kaufman]'s heart was with Yeager. And not only that, he felt the astronauts, rather than being heroic, were really minor leaguers, mechanical men of no particular quality, not great pilots at all, simply the product of hype.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1700270#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1700270&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=oFeQuIcMsIY:JrDz4LgMuFQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=oFeQuIcMsIY:JrDz4LgMuFQ:V_sGLiPBpWU\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=oFeQuIcMsIY:JrDz4LgMuFQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=oFeQuIcMsIY:JrDz4LgMuFQ:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=oFeQuIcMsIY:JrDz4LgMuFQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=oFeQuIcMsIY:JrDz4LgMuFQ:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a>\n</div></div>",
