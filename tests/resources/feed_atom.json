Bring your app to life with dramatically less code, interactive tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.\n      </p>\n\n\n      <p>\n      No matter where you\u2019re working from -- whether it\u2019s your kitchen table or an office, we know you need a programming language, an IDE and a powerful UI framework that can save you time and reduce how much code you need to write. So we built Jetpack Compose to make you (and us!) more productive with building UI.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We started with <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack\">Android Jetpack</a> \u2014 taking the hardest, most common developer problems on Android and creating a suite of libraries that ensure high quality apps that work across all versions of the platform. Today, 84% of the top 10,000 apps in the Play store are using a Jetpack library.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Then we heard how developers love Kotlin, with over 70% of the top 1000 apps and 60% of pro Android developers using Kotlin today. The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/google-home\">Google Home</a> app saw, in certain instances, an 80% reduction in lines of code by using Kotlin and a decrease of NullPointerExceptions by 33% compared to a similar past period. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/duolingo-kotlin\">Duolingo</a>, saw reduced line count by an average of 30%.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Finally, we heard strong feedback from the community that developers like the simplicity of declarative APIs for building UI. Jetpack Compose combines all three of these: APIs for high quality apps at scale, an intuitive language, and a reactive programming model.\n      </p>\n\n\n       <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cxPO9bE5QT4/X0Vw6rOOAAI/AAAAAAAAPjg/UmpOu9X6wHMUFaEjuJEdfOcOcwuKEefTwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-05-06%2Bat%2B9.48.28%2BAM.png\"><img alt=\"Jetpack\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cxPO9bE5QT4/X0Vw6rOOAAI/AAAAAAAAPjg/UmpOu9X6wHMUFaEjuJEdfOcOcwuKEefTwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-05-06%2Bat%2B9.48.28%2BAM.png\"></a> \n\n\n      <h1>Jetpack Compose: Now in Alpha</h1>\n\n\n      <p>\n      <strong>Jetpack Compose Alpha</strong> has what you need to build full-fledged Android apps, including powerful tools and interoperability with existing Android views so you don\u2019t need to rewrite your app. Compose APIs are designed and developed hand-in-hand with a set of <a href=\"http://www.github.com/android/compose-samples\">canonical sample apps</a> that use Material Design that we\u2019re excited to release today! You can <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup#sample\">import and explore</a> the latest samples directly in Android Studio as well.\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LJVcQ2ShKn8/X0VxshW7nBI/AAAAAAAAPjs/z2a9aawkpl84NDnAsW924w7b46DdSI05ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/compose_samples.gif\"><img alt=\"compose\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LJVcQ2ShKn8/X0VxshW7nBI/AAAAAAAAPjs/z2a9aawkpl84NDnAsW924w7b46DdSI05ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/compose_samples.gif\"></a> \n\n      <p>\n      The alpha release includes:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li>Animations\n\n      </li><li>Constraint Layout\n\n      </li><li>Initial A11Y support\n\n      </li><li>Input and Gestures\n\n      </li><li>Interoperability with Views (start mixing Composable functions in your existing app)\n\n      </li><li>Lazy Lists\n\n      </li><li>Material UI components\n\n      </li><li>Performance optimizations\n\n      </li><li>Testing\n\n      </li><li>Text and editable Text\n\n      </li><li>Theming and Graphics\n\n      </li><li>Window management\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n      We've also added a number of new capabilities to Android Studio 4.2 canary, in close partnership with the <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/\">JetBrains Kotlin team</a>, to help you build apps with Compose:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li>Compose Code completion\n\n      </li><li>Compose Preview Annotations\n\n      </li><li>Deploy individual composables to any device\n\n      </li><li>Interactive Compose previews\n\n      </li><li>Kotlin compiler plugin for code generation\n\n      </li><li>Sample Data API for Compose\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n        \n\n      <h2>Thinking in Compose</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Compose uses a programming model that is quite different from the existing model of building UI on Android. Historically, an Android view hierarchy has been represented as a tree of UI widgets. As the state of the app changes, the UI hierarchy needs to be updated to display the current data. The most common way of updating the UI is to walk the tree using functions like <a href=\"https://android.devsite.corp.google.com/reference/android/view/View#findViewById(int)\">findViewById()</a>, and change nodes by calling methods like: </p><pre> button.setText(String) </pre> <pre>container.addView(View) </pre> <pre> img.setImageBitmap(Bitmap) </pre> These methods change the internal state of the widget. Not only can this be tedious, but updating views manually increases the likelihood of errors (e.g. forgetting to update a view).\n      \n      <p>\n      Jetpack Compose is a fully declarative component-based approach, meaning you describe your UI as functions that transform data into a UI hierarchy. When the underlying data changes, the Compose framework automatically updates the UI hierarchy for you, making it simple to build UIs easily and quickly.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n\n      </p>  \n\n\n      <h2>Full interop with existing Android views</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Adopting any new framework is a big change for existing projects and codebases, which is why we\u2019ve designed Compose to be as easy to adopt as Kotlin \u2014 it is fully interoperable with existing Android code, from day one.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Migrating to Compose depends on you and your team. If you're building a new app, the best option might be to implement your entire UI with Compose. We know that most of you have large existing codebases, so rather than rewriting your app, you can combine Compose with your existing UI design.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      There are two main ways you can combine Compose with a view-based UI:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li>You can add Compose elements into your existing UI, either by creating an entirely new Compose-based screen, or by adding Compose elements into an existing fragment or view layout.\n\n      </li><li>You can add a view-based UI element into your composable functions. Doing so lets you add non-Compose widgets, such as MapView or WebView, into a Compose-based design.\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n      We\u2019ve also published a new library, <a href=\"https://material-components.github.io/material-components-android-compose-theme-adapter/\">MDC Compose Theme Adapter</a>, which allows you to reuse your existing <a href=\"https://material.io/develop/android/\">Material Components</a> themes within your Compose UI.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      To learn more, try the <a href=\"https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/android-compose-migration\">Compose for existing apps codelab</a> or check out these two samples:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li><a href=\"http://tivi.app\">Tivi</a> and <a href=\"http://goo.gle/sunflower-compose\">Sunflower</a> are existing apps which are being integrated with Compose\n\n      </li><li>Crane <a href=\"https://github.com/android/compose-samples/\">sample app</a>, embeds a MapView in Compose\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n        \n\n      <h2>Powerful Tools</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Jetpack Compose is built with powerful tooling in Android Studio, designed to help you iterate quickly on the piece of UI you\u2019re working on.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      The Compose layout preview enables you to preview your Compose components without having to deploy your app to a device or emulator. As you develop your app, your previews update to help you review your changes faster. To create a layout preview, write a composable function that does not take any parameters, and add the </p><pre> @Preview annotation </pre> After you build your app, the preview function's UI appears in Studio's <strong>Preview</strong> pane.\n      \n\n       <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nkxrJO6kIZk/X0VyUgVOlaI/AAAAAAAAPj0/rnNtkiT_0z0cYyr_kBBTVw4nYIuIi6QkACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/jetpack-compose-preview.gif\"><img alt=\"Jetpack\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nkxrJO6kIZk/X0VyUgVOlaI/AAAAAAAAPj0/rnNtkiT_0z0cYyr_kBBTVw4nYIuIi6QkACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/jetpack-compose-preview.gif\"></a> \n\n      <p>\n      Android Studio provides an <em>interactive preview</em> mode. While you're in interactive preview mode, you can click or type in your UI elements, and the UI responds as if it were in the installed app.\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VJs-LV-Ec0c/X0Vy6FcZbBI/AAAAAAAAPj8/c2VxYCzVnaE5dxZEOr_O6M2quFTfoG2KACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/unnamed.gif\"><img alt=\"Jetpack\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VJs-LV-Ec0c/X0Vy6FcZbBI/AAAAAAAAPj8/c2VxYCzVnaE5dxZEOr_O6M2quFTfoG2KACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/unnamed.gif\"></a> \n\n\n      <p>\n      You can also deploy a single composable to your physical device or Android Emulator. Android Studio creates a new activity containing the UI generated by that function, and deploys it to your app on the device. This lets you try out the UI on an actual device without needing to reinstall the entire app or navigate to its location.\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wjMlDBTfOqA/X0VzQz9HcyI/AAAAAAAAPkE/mcj3BH39R-4_PIO1MHWyL8lQEq8ze7QQQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252813%2529.png\"><img alt=\"Jetpack\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wjMlDBTfOqA/X0VzQz9HcyI/AAAAAAAAPkE/mcj3BH39R-4_PIO1MHWyL8lQEq8ze7QQQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252813%2529.png\"></a> \n\n\n      <h2>Get started with Jetpack Compose</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      To get started with Jetpack Compose, try the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/tutorial\">Compose Tutorial</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/setup#add-compose\">get setup</a>.

For each of the #11WeeksOfAndroid, we\u2019re diving into key areas so you don\u2019t miss anything. This week, we spotlighted games, media, and 5G; here\u2019s a look at what you should know.\n      </p>\n      <h3>What's the buzz in Android 11?</h3>\n\n\n      <ul>\n\n      <li>You can now control media applications from a dedicated space within the notification area while enabling features such as playback resumption and seamless transfer.\n\n      </li><li>New and updated 5g APIs help you unlock transformative new user experiences.\n\n      </li><li>Adds new support for key game tools and technologies. On top of that foundation, we're building tools to both improve your game developer experience and help you better characterize the performance of your game, services to help you expand the reach of your game to more devices and new audiences, and new and improved features to support your games' go-to-market with Google Play.\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      \n      <h3>Android 11 media</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      We covered how to take advantage of Android 11's new media controls by making sure your app is using <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media/app/NotificationCompat.MediaStyle\">MediaStyle</a></code> with a valid <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media-apps/working-with-a-media-session\">MediaSession</a></code> token.  We showed how to support Media resumption by making your app discoverable with a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media/MediaBrowserServiceCompat\">MediaBrowserServiceCompat</a></code>, using the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/media/MediaBrowserServiceCompat.BrowserRoot#EXTRA_RECENT:kotlin.String\">EXTRA_RECENT</a></code> hint to help with resuming content, and handling the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/support/v4/media/session/MediaSessionCompat.Callback#onPlay()\">onPlay</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/media/MediaBrowserService#onGetRoot(java.lang.String,%20int,%20android.os.Bundle)\">onGetRoot</a></code> callbacks.  Finally we showed you how to leverage the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/mediarouter\">MediaRouter jetpack library</a> to support seamless media transfer between devices.  Check out the updated version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/android/uamp\">UAMP</a> sample which contains a reference implementation for media controls and playback resumption.\n\n\n      </p>\n      \n\n      <h3>Android 11 and 5G</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      We covered some of the primary ways <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/connectivity/enhance-with-5g\">apps can benefit from 5g</a>, including:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li>Turning indoor use cases into outdoor use cases\n\n      </li><li>Turning photo-centric UX into video-centric or AR-centric UX\n\n      </li><li>Prefetch helpfully to make your app even more responsive\n\n      </li><li>Turn niche use cases into mainstream use cases, such as allowing streaming content everywhere\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>Android 11 adds new APIs and updates existing APIs to ensure you have all the tools you need to leverage the capabilities of 5G, such as an enhanced <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features/5g#estimator\">bandwidth estimation API</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features/5g#detection\">5G detection capabilities</a>, and a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features/5g#meteredness\"> meteredness flag </a> from cellular carriers. The <a href=\"https://d.android.com/preview/behavior-changes-all#emulator-5g\">Android emulator</a> now enables you to develop and test these APIs without needing a 5G device or network connection. All of this and more is available from our <a href=\"http://d.android.com/5g\">dedicated 5G page</a>.</p>\n\n\n      <h3>Catch up on what's happening with game development</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      We presented a special \"11 Weeks\" episode of The Android Game Developer Show providing an update on the tools, services, and technologies we're bringing to help you build, optimize, and distribute great games.\n      </p>\n\n\n        \n\n      <p>\n      Check out <a href=\"http://d.android.com/games\">d.android.com/games</a> to learn about everything we've covered this week and more, and stay up to date by signing up for the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/updates\">games quarterly newsletter</a>.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Android game development tooling</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      In Android Studio 4.1, we enhanced the System Trace view of the CPU Profiler and added the Native Memory Profiler, and both can now be launched standalone from Android Studio. The <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/whats-new-in-android-studio-system-trace-5841465c5935\">System Trace</a> and <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/native-memory-profiling-with-android-studio-4-1-33a9e6b44be\">Native Memory</a> blog posts have more details on how to use them with your game or app.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      You can sign up for developer previews of the <a href=\"https://services.google.com/fb/forms/androidgamedevelopmentextension-developerpreview/\">Android Game Development Extension</a>, and the <a href=\"https://gpuinspector.dev/\">Android GPU Inspector</a>.

As app developers, this mission is as important now as it\u2019s ever been. You\u2019ve probably heard the buzz around 5G and wondered: what does this mean for my app? As we dive into Media &amp; Games as part of this weeks' #11WeeksofAndroid, two areas where 5G offers a lot of potential, we wanted to spotlight ways for you to think about taking advantage of <a href=\"http://d.android.com/5g\">5G for your app or game</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Transforming your app or game with 5G: unlocking new experiences</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      5G isn\u2019t just about faster connectivity: it\u2019s about unlocking transformative new experiences, and we want to see how you continue to push the bar.\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li><strong>Turn indoor use cases into outdoor use cases:</strong> Suddenly, everything you could only do indoors comes alive outside, like high-quality video chat and playing multiplayer games wherever you happen to be.\n\n      </li><li><strong>Turn photo-centric UX into video-centric or AR-centric UX:</strong> Upgrade your users\u2019 experience by replacing photos with videos and by incorporating augmented reality into your UX.\n\n      </li><li><strong>Prefetch helpfully, delight rather than buffer:</strong> Use the increased bandwidth to prefetch content, further enhancing the responsiveness of your app or game.\n\n      </li><li><strong>Turn niche use cases into mainstream use cases:</strong> Streaming content on older networks was the exception. Make streaming content the new mainstream with 5G.\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n      We\u2019ve been hard at work building in support for 5G on Android, and have been working with 5G carriers starting with Verizon and AT&amp;T in the U.S., as well as others in Europe and Asia to provide necessary Android features for app developers looking to build 5G experiences.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      In addition to working with the carriers, we have been updating and adding new APIs to ensure you have all the tools you need to leverage the capabilities of 5G. First, we enhanced the functionality of our <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features/5g#estimator\">bandwidth estimation API</a>. Then we added <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features/5g#detection\">5G detection capabilities</a>, so you know when to take it up a notch. Lastly, we added a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features/5g#meteredness\">meteredness flag</a> from cellular carriers so you know when your user isn\u2019t being charged for bandwidth, and can really bring it!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We\u2019ve also added features to the <a href=\"https://d.android.com/preview/behavior-changes-all#emulator-5g\">Android SDK emulator</a> to enable you to develop and test these APIs without needing a 5G device or network connection.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      All of this means that 5G starts here and now.

This is achieved with three related features: media controls, playback resumption and seamless transfer.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      This article will explain what these features are, how they work together and how you can take advantage of them in your apps.</p>\n\n      <h1>Media Controls</h1>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Android 11's media controls are found below the Quick Settings panel and represent a dedicated persistent space for controlling media playback.\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-irSyMsINZhM/Xz7Exzb1zGI/AAAAAAAAPg0/XqqR7G1_pOk8S6tH90s3z-sIP-wfx836ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/media-controls.gif\"><img alt=\"Media\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-irSyMsINZhM/Xz7Exzb1zGI/AAAAAAAAPg0/XqqR7G1_pOk8S6tH90s3z-sIP-wfx836ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/media-controls.gif\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Media controls in Android 11</p>\n\n      <p>\n      Part of the motivation for media controls is that users often have multiple media apps (music player, podcasts, video player etc) and regularly switch between them. Media controls display up to five current and recent media sessions in a carousel allowing the user to swipe between them.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      On Android 10 and earlier, media notifications for multiple apps can occupy most of the notification area. All those control buttons can also be confusing. Moving the controls into a dedicated space means that there's more room for other notifications, and provides a more consistent user experience for controlling media apps.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Here's the comparison:\n      </p>\n\n\n       <div id=\"flexParent\">\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J8gg5L3wo0Y/Xz7F1dwOSzI/AAAAAAAAPhA/f_xAncS9UacNxLx76Um4ELwoCuNgNFu1ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25283%2529.png\"><img alt=\"image\" border=\"0\" id=\"flexImg\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J8gg5L3wo0Y/Xz7F1dwOSzI/AAAAAAAAPhA/f_xAncS9UacNxLx76Um4ELwoCuNgNFu1ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25283%2529.png\"></a>\n\n\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ogv84kIxnxo/Xz7GFzr0DjI/AAAAAAAAPhI/b9Z3pO9iBYoKxL2ZJ2guieUl9LL7fh3sQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25284%2529.png\"><img alt=\"image of screen\" border=\"0\" id=\"flexImg\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ogv84kIxnxo/Xz7GFzr0DjI/AAAAAAAAPhI/b9Z3pO9iBYoKxL2ZJ2guieUl9LL7fh3sQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25284%2529.png\"></a> </div> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">Android 10 media notifications (left) Android 11 media controls (right)</p>\n\n\n      <h2>Displaying media controls for your app</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Now, the really good news.

Media resumption solves this problem.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      There are two stages to media resumption: <strong>discovering recent media apps</strong> and <strong>resuming playback</strong>.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Discovering recent media apps</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      After booting, Android will look for recent media apps and ask them what their most recently played content was. It will then create media controls for that content.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      To be discoverable your app must provide a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/media/MediaBrowserService\">MediaBrowserService</a></code>, typically using the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media/MediaBrowserServiceCompat\">MediaBrowserServiceCompat</a></code> library from Android Jetpack.\n\n\n      </p><p>\n      On boot, Android will call your MediaBrowserServiceCompat's <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media/MediaBrowserServiceCompat#onGetRoot(java.lang.String,%20int,%20android.os.Bundle)\">onGetRoot</a></code> method, so it's imperative that you return quickly.  Usually you would return the root of your media tree from this method but the system also specifies the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/media/MediaBrowserServiceCompat.BrowserRoot#EXTRA_RECENT:kotlin.String\">EXTRA_RECENT</a></code> hint.\n\n      </p><p>\n      You should treat <code>EXTRA_RECENT</code> as a special case and instead return the root of a media tree that contains the most recently played media item as the first element.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      The system will call your <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/media/MediaBrowserServiceCompat#onLoadChildren(kotlin.String,%20androidx.media.MediaBrowserServiceCompat.Result)\">onLoadChildren</a></code> method to obtain this media tree, which is a list of <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/browse/MediaBrowser.MediaItem\">MediaItem</a></code> objects.\n\n      </p><p>\n      Here's a diagram showing how the system and a media app interact to retrieve the most recently played item.\n      </p>\n\n\n       <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e6LogMsehxM/Xz7I5OFtOII/AAAAAAAAPhs/Wl3DCLl1rTctUK8HrcUsC5SYXAV2NMPUACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25288%2529.png\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e6LogMsehxM/Xz7I5OFtOII/AAAAAAAAPhs/Wl3DCLl1rTctUK8HrcUsC5SYXAV2NMPUACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25288%2529.png\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">How the system retrieves the most recently played item from the MediaBrowserService</p>\n\n      <p>\n      For the first playable media item in this list the system will create <strong>static media controls</strong> with just a play button.\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gJ_uQoslAOk/Xz7JU_8AKiI/AAAAAAAAPh0/MI-6txEwG2ETGX1-eIOlOUyYMPPCdK-cgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25289%2529.png\"><img alt=\"static\" border=\"0\" media=\"media\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gJ_uQoslAOk/Xz7JU_8AKiI/AAAAAAAAPh0/MI-6txEwG2ETGX1-eIOlOUyYMPPCdK-cgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%25289%2529.png\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">Static media controls</p>\n\n      <p>\n      At this point no media session has been created.

You should override the media session <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/support/v4/media/session/MediaSessionCompat.Callback#onPlay()\">onPlay</a></code> callback in order to start playback of your media content and create your <code>MediaStyle</code> notification.\n\n      </p><p>\n      Once you post the notification the static media controls will be swapped with the media controls created from your notification.\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6s_bixWzvlY/Xz7JyeZQj2I/AAAAAAAAPiA/09t8KIshEaE6Occ08J1PsMkyLRedw0noQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252810%2529.png\"><img alt=\"Graphic\" border=\"0\" media=\"media\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6s_bixWzvlY/Xz7JyeZQj2I/AAAAAAAAPiA/09t8KIshEaE6Occ08J1PsMkyLRedw0noQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/pasted%2Bimage%2B0%2B%252810%2529.png\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"><strong>Figure 7:</strong> Diagram showing interaction between System UI and media app when resuming playback</p>\n\n\n      <h1>Seamless media transfer</h1>\n\n\n      <p>\n      As well as being able to resume media sessions, Android 11 also allows you to easily transfer playback from one device to another.

As Kotlin has grown, we\u2019ve seen continued investment in the language from JetBrains (Kotlin's creators), the open source community, and increasingly our own teams at Google.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Today we are excited to share the news about the Kotlin 1.4 release, the next milestone in the evolution of Kotlin, which contains new language features, improved compilers and tools. Below you'll find a brief rundown of some exciting new features in this release. You can read more about Kotlin 1.4 in the <a href=\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/?post_type=kotlin&amp;p=65244&amp;preview=true\">official announcement</a>.\n      </p>\n      <h2>New language features</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      New language features introduced in Kotlin 1.4 improve the ergonomics of writing Kotlin code. Here's just one example:\n      </p>\n      <h3>SAM conversions for Kotlin interfaces</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Previously, only functional interfaces (i.e. having just a Single Abstract Method - SAM) defined in the Java programming language benefited from the shorthand syntax in Kotlin:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">executor.execute { println(\"This is shorthand for passing in a Runnable\") }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      In Kotlin 1.4 you can now mark your Kotlin interfaces as functional and get them to work in a similar manner by adding the <code>fun</code> keyword:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">fun interface Transformer&lt;T, U&gt; {\n      fun transform(x: T): U\n      }\n      val length = Transformer {\n      x: String -&gt; x.length\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      You can read more about new language features such as: mixing named and positional arguments, trailing comma, callable reference improvements, and using <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code> inside <code>when</code> included in loops on the Kotlin 1.4 <a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew14.html#mixing-named-and-positional-arguments\">release notes page</a>.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Explicit API mode</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      One additional feature is the new <em><a href=\"https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/whatsnew14.html#explicit-api-mode-for-library-authors\">Explicit API mode</a></em> for authors of libraries written in Kotlin.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      It enforces certain language properties of Kotlin that are normally optional, such as specifying visibility modifiers, as well as explicit typing for any public declarations, in order to prevent mistakes when designing the public API of your library. Refer to the linked documentation for instructions how to enable Explicit API mode and start using these additional checks.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Compiler improvements</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      The language features mentioned above are some of the most developer-facing changes in Kotlin 1.4, however the bulk of work went into improving the overall quality and performance of the Kotlin compiler.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      One of the benefits all developers can take advantage of right now is the <strong>new, more powerful type inference algorithm</strong>, which is now enabled by default. It will help developers be more productive by supporting more smart-casts and cases where types can be inferred automatically.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Other than the type inference algorithm, Kotlin 1.4 also brings in optional, <strong> Alpha stability compiler backends for Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/JS</strong>, which generate code in what's called internal representation (IR) also used in the Kotlin/Native backend.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      The Kotlin/JVM IR backend is a requirement for Jetpack Compose, and Google engineers are working together with JetBrains to make it the default JVM compiler backend in the future.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      That's why, even if you're not currently developing with Jetpack Compose, we encourage you to try out the new Kotlin/JVM backend, currently in alpha, and to file any issues and feature requests to the <a href=\"http://kotl.in/issue\">issue tracker</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      To enable the new JVM IR backend, specify an additional compiler option in your Gradle build script:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">kotlinOptions.useIR = true</pre>\n\n\n      <h2>Try Kotlin 1.4 now!</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      There are two steps to updating your projects and IDE to Kotlin 1.4.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      First, make sure you are on the latest version of <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio\">Android Studio</a> to maximize the performance benefits and compatibility with the newest Kotlin plugin. Android Studio will prompt you when a Kotlin 1.4.0 plugin that is compatible with your IDE version is available. Alternatively, you can go to Preferences | Plugins and manually trigger the update.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Once the plugin is enabled, you can upgrade your app project to use Kotlin 1.4 by updating the Kotlin Gradle plugin version in your <em>build.gradle</em> scripts. Depending on how you manage your plugins, you either have to update the version in the top-level project's <code>buildscript</code> block:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">buildscript {\n      dependencies {\n      classpath \"org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.4.0\"\n      }\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Or change the version number in the <code>plugins</code> block in a module level <em>build.gradle</em> file:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">plugins {\n      id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android' version '1.4.0'\n      }\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Make sure to read the language changes carefully and update your project's code to ensure compatibility with the latest release. Enjoy Kotlin 1.4!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <em>Java is a registered trademark of Oracle and/or its affiliates.</em>\n      </p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n      <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=rDVHRsbjLUo:KeYjuyn6k6k:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=rDVHRsbjLUo:KeYjuyn6k6k:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=rDVHRsbjLUo:KeYjuyn6k6k:-BTjWOF_DHI\"></a>\n      </div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/rDVHRsbjLUo\" width=\"1\"></div>",

This week, we spotlighted Android Beyond Phones; here\u2019s a look at what you should know.</em>\n      \n      With Android, people can experience the apps and services that they love across many devices &amp; surfaces. Beyond phones, Android offers distinct yet familiar experiences on devices of all shapes and sizes, ranging from the smallest smartwatch screens, to larger displays on foldables and Chromebooks, to in-car entertainment systems, and all the way up to the largest television screens. For the past 4 days, we featured a daily deep dive into each of these exciting form factors that are providing developers with new and growing ways to engage people. Read on for a recap.\n      \n      <strong>Android TV</strong>\n      \n      We kicked off the week with <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOV6Ef9zDg0&amp;list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc-Z8NeBXJkf1bzUVhx3fvh4&amp;index=2\">Android TV</a></strong>, which is now partnering with 7 of the top 10 OEMs and over 160 television operators across the globe. The Android TV team highlighted <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/6-new-ways-to-engage-with-users-on.html\">6 upcoming launches</a>, like instant app trials right from Google Play and an updated Gboard, to help developers acquire more users, more easily monetize, and build even more engaging experiences.  Then, <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/android-tv-best-practices-for-engaging-apps-acd0219ff395\">new resources were published</a> to help developers build their first Android TV app, or even go deep on new integrations like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L-XjCf018s&amp;list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc-Z8NeBXJkf1bzUVhx3fvh4&amp;index=3\">Cast Connect </a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARuf97ncE4w&amp;list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc-Z8NeBXJkf1bzUVhx3fvh4&amp;index=4\">frictionless subscriptions</a>.

For each week, we\u2019re diving into a key area and this week we\u2019re focusing on Android Beyond Phones. Today, we\u2019ll share what\u2019s happening with Wear OS by Google.</em>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Wearable technologies help people lead healthier lives and connect with important, timely information. Today, we're sharing our areas of investment focusing on the fundamentals, bringing even more helpful experiences to more watches, and giving users more choice in a device ecosystem.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Focusing on fundamentals</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Wearables are designed to instantly connect people with what's important throughout the day. That's why we're focused on fundamentals like performance and power.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      In the next OTA update coming in the fall, we\u2019re improving performance by making it faster to access your info and start your apps. We\u2019re simplifying the pairing process to make onboarding easier. You\u2019ll see improvements to our SysUI for more intuitive controls for managing different watch modes and workouts. And with CPU core improvements, you\u2019ll also see up to a 20% speed improvement in startup time for your apps.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Finally, we continue to support advancements in technology to bring new functionality, such as LTE, and expand levels of performance with the new Qualcomm\u00ae Snapdragon Wear\u2122 4100 and 4100+ platforms. We are excited by the kinds of wearable experiences that can be enabled in the future.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong> More helpful experiences</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Wearables showcase important information at a glance. Some of the most used features of Wear OS by Google are hands-free timers and tracking fitness metrics. In response to COVID-19, we built a handwashing timer that helps ensure users practice good hygiene.\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zdjrQIYW4Ds/XzRHgORyIOI/AAAAAAAAPeI/2oLrV3dR9FgNvj-7ZilTUsCj-ffPeADcACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B1_%2BHandwash.gif\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zdjrQIYW4Ds/XzRHgORyIOI/AAAAAAAAPeI/2oLrV3dR9FgNvj-7ZilTUsCj-ffPeADcACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B1_%2BHandwash.gif\"></a> \n\n      <p>\n      And later this year, you\u2019ll see a beautiful new weather experience for Wear OS by Google.

We\u2019re continuing to add <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/five-new-android-features--/\">new features</a> to make the experience more seamless for users and help developers reach more drivers with in-car apps.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Expanding Android Auto\u2019s app ecosystem</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      One of our most common requests for Android Auto continues to be support for more apps in the car. We currently have over 3,000 apps in Google Play whose in-car experiences have been purpose-built for driving.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Today, we\u2019re showcasing our work with early access partners to build apps in new categories for Android Auto, including navigation, parking and electric vehicle charging. Using our new Android for Cars App Library, we\u2019re able to ensure that all tasks within an app can be achieved with minimal glances or taps.\n      </p>\n\n\n       <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vKb1-7G-Hhc/XzGjZ55QbCI/AAAAAAAAPcs/o6EntDHnGbcodAILNSb6RwYYA_9sNrhvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B1_%2BEAP%2BAndroid%2BAuto%2Bapp%2Bexpansion.png\"><img alt=\"image\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vKb1-7G-Hhc/XzGjZ55QbCI/AAAAAAAAPcs/o6EntDHnGbcodAILNSb6RwYYA_9sNrhvwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B1_%2BEAP%2BAndroid%2BAuto%2Bapp%2Bexpansion.png\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Early access partners for new apps on Android Auto </p>\n\n      <p>\n      To mitigate driver distraction, we collaborated with government, industry and academic institutions to develop our own <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFHjmDrUF9A\">best practice guidelines</a> that we apply to every aspect of our product development process. With our standard templates and guidelines, developers have the tools to easily optimize their apps for cars, without needing to become an expert in driver distraction.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Our early access partners will be releasing new apps to their beta testers by the end of this year. Pending additional testing and feedback, we then plan to make these APIs publicly available for all developers to build Android Auto apps in these categories.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n\n      </p> <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q1PE31sWfXk/XzHU2kf2eJI/AAAAAAAAPdw/6DQF9Q3JFpMZP8mMTbB8HEMOQeyK74ljACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/final_5f31ce27e5bc060015ae78e4_186813%2B%25282%2529%2B%25281%2529.gif\"><img alt=\"Android\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q1PE31sWfXk/XzHU2kf2eJI/AAAAAAAAPdw/6DQF9Q3JFpMZP8mMTbB8HEMOQeyK74ljACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/final_5f31ce27e5bc060015ae78e4_186813%2B%25282%2529%2B%25281%2529.gif\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"> We're partnering with some of the leading navigation, parking and electric vehicle charging apps around the world including ChargePoint, SpotHero and Sygic. </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <strong>Android Automotive OS adoption</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      More recently, we introduced <a href=\"https://source.android.com/devices/automotive/start/what_automotive\">Android Automotive OS</a> as a full-stack, open source and highly customizable platform powering vehicle infotainment systems. With Android Automotive OS, car manufacturers are able to have apps and services like Google Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play built into vehicles so that a mobile device is not required for common activities like navigation, downloading third-party apps and listening to media. <a href=\"https://www.polestar.com/us/polestar-2/\">Polestar 2</a>, the first car running Android Automotive OS with Google built in, is now on the road and available for customers globally. In addition, Volvo Cars, Renault, General Motors and more have announced plans for infotainment systems powered by Android Automotive OS with Google apps and services built-in.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Extending the reach of media apps in cars</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      As more manufacturers begin to ship cars with infotainment systems powered by Android Automotive OS, developers have the opportunity to deliver a seamless media experience using Google Play in the car. If you already have a media app for Android Auto, you can extend the reach by adding support for Android Automotive OS. The process for porting over your apps is simple with most of the work already done, just <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/cars/media/automotive-os\">follow these steps</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Making it easier to develop media apps for Android Automotive OS </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      For the past year, we have been on a journey to allow app developers to design, develop, test and publish media apps directly on Google Play in the car. We are happy to share that this is now possible.\n      </p>\n\n       <div id=\"flexParent\">\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sZ0_6GQV6zY/XzGmSw3Q2-I/AAAAAAAAPdE/6wa8TYfWFQM-krqiwqS4EvoQugyy7UMswCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B3_%2BPolestar%2B2%2BEmulator.png\"><img alt=\"Android Auto image\" border=\"0\" id=\"flexImg\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sZ0_6GQV6zY/XzGmSw3Q2-I/AAAAAAAAPdE/6wa8TYfWFQM-krqiwqS4EvoQugyy7UMswCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B3_%2BPolestar%2B2%2BEmulator.png\"></a>\n\n\n      <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lSjoQ291WB0/XzGmvaJXcnI/AAAAAAAAPdM/jzYb7GuOkecrwqj5JajFsw-y0tFiUXBrwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B4_%2BGoogle%2BGeneric%2BEmulator.png\"><img alt=\"Image of Polestar 2 and Google Generic Automative system\" border=\"0\" id=\"flexImg\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lSjoQ291WB0/XzGmvaJXcnI/AAAAAAAAPdM/jzYb7GuOkecrwqj5JajFsw-y0tFiUXBrwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Image%2B4_%2BGoogle%2BGeneric%2BEmulator.png\"></a>\n      </div> \n\n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Polestar 2 and Google Generic Automotive system images for Android emulator </p>\n\n      <p>\n      We have made updates to the Android Automotive OS <a href=\"https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/automotive-os-apps/\">design guidelines</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/cars/media/automotive-os\">development documentation</a> for you to add support for your media apps.

There are now over 80% more Android TV monthly active devices than a year ago! Working with 7 of the top 10 Smart TV OEMs and over 160 TV Operators has helped give users more options to spruce up their living room with Android TV. But connecting with this many people wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the developer ecosystem building ~7,000 apps for Google Play on Android TV. Together, our users can now watch, play, and do more on their TVs.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Over the past year, we\u2019ve introduced new features to Android TV to make discovering and accessing your content even easier for users. We updated Google Play with a refreshed look and <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/products/google-fit/be-healthy-at-home/\">new app collections</a> while making it easier for users to <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android-tv/find-new-faves-faster/\">subscribe to apps</a>. We made additions to the Android TV home screen to highlight <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android-tv/find-new-faves-faster/\">trending</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android-tv/stay-entertained-at-home/\">important</a> content. And most recently, we released <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/introducing-cast-connect-android-tv.html\">Cast Connect</a>, so your users can cast their favorite content directly to its native Android TV app.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We\u2019ve heard from you on how else we can help support you.

As we\u2019ve continued to update the beta, we\u2019ve launched a number of key releases including:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li>Major performance increases across different browsers, which many of you requested\n\n      </li><li>New menus and headers on mobile for a better responsive experience\n\n      </li><li>Features including <a href=\"https://play.google.com/console/inbox\">Inbox</a> (your Google Play Console messaging hub) and enhanced <a href=\"https://play.google.com/console/about/subscriptionreporting/\">subscription retention reports</a>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n      Earlier this week, we hosted three webinars to get you up to speed on what\u2019s new and what\u2019s changed from the classic Play Console. If you weren\u2019t able to tune in live, you can watch the videos on demand below.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      If you\u2019re just getting started, join Google Play Console\u2019s lead engineer, Dan White, for a look at new features like Inbox, policy status, app content, and enhanced team management capabilities.\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      To help you release with even more confidence, check out this webinar with Google Play UX designer Matt McGriskin, who will walk you through the new testing and publishing workflow.\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      Finally, if you want to grow your audience, join Google Play engineer Ryan Fanelli for app store optimization best practices and an overview of the new acquisition reports.\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      You can also take our <a href=\"http://g.co/playacademy/console\">Play Console Play Academy course</a>. And if you haven\u2019t already, please opt in to <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/android-developers.googplay-console-2-step-verification.html\">2-Step Verification</a> to sign into Google Play Console, which will be required later this year.\n      </p>\n      <h3><strong>Android App Bundle</strong></h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      We\u2019re glad so many of you are already using the Android App Bundle to release your apps and games. We\u2019re continuing to make app bundles a better publishing format with several recent improvements:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li>The recently-launched <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/asset-delivery\">Play Asset Delivery</a> brings the benefits of app bundles to games and allows developers to improve the user experience while cutting delivery costs and reducing the size of their game\n\n      </li><li>You can now shrink resources when building modular apps\n\n      </li><li>Install-time modules are now automatically fused by default when app bundles are processed into distribution APKs\n\n      </li><li>Feature-to-feature dependency is now stable in <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/05/android-studio-4.html\">Android Studio 4.0</a>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n      If you haven\u2019t switched to the app bundle yet, we\u2019ve published some <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/answers-to-common-questions-about-app-signing-by-google-play-b28fef836af0\">FAQs on Play App Signing</a>\u2014which is required for app bundles\u2014as well as guidance on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/test\">how to test your app bundle</a>. <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/recent-android-app-bundle-improvements.html\">Check out our recent blog post</a> to find out more about the recent improvements we\u2019ve made to developing, testing, and publishing with app bundles.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMr-b660Esw&amp;t=206s\">announced</a> as part of the Android 11 Beta launch, we intend to <strong>require new apps to publish with the Android App Bundle on Google Play in the second half of 2021</strong>. This means that we will also be deprecating APK expansion files (OBBs) and making Play Asset Delivery the standard for publishing games larger than 150MB.\n      </p>\n      <h3><strong>In-app review API</strong></h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Because ratings and reviews are such an important touchpoint with your users, many of you asked us to give users the ability to leave a review from within your app. Now, with the new in-app review API, you can do just that. Choose when to prompt users for a review and get  feedback when it\u2019s most valuable. <strong>The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review\">in-app review API</a> is available now in the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore\">Play Core Library</a></strong>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We've also released <a href=\"https://github.com/android/app-bundle-samples/tree/master/PlayCoreKtx\">a unified sample for Play Core APIs</a>, which includes in-app reviews as well as on-demand feature modules and in-app updates. Check it out to learn how to use these APIs using our Play Core Kotlin extensions artifact, which makes working with Play Core easier for Kotlin users.\n      </p>\n      <h3><strong>Google Play Commerce</strong></h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      We\u2019ve made a number of updates to Play Commerce aimed at building user trust through <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/04/building-user-trust-through-more.html\">clearer, easier payment experiences</a>. The user trust policies we announced in April offer users greater transparency, safer trial experiences, and easier cancellations.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We also launched <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/meet-google-play-billing-library.html\">Play Billing Library 3</a>, which supports cash payments, a better subscription promo code redemption experience, purchase attribution, and more. Billing Play Library 3 will be mandatory for all new apps starting August 2, 2021.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      For more information, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnrNckXeSjQ\">this session</a> with Mrinalini Loew, Group Project Manager for Google Play Commerce.\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      We\u2019ve also just kicked off a six-article series on Google Play Billing, which you can follow <a href=\"https://medium.com/googleplaydev/working-with-google-play-billing-part-1-387677bd632b\">here on Medium</a>.\n      </p>\n      <h3><strong>Google Play Pass</strong></h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Google Play Pass enables developers to earn additional revenue and connect with untapped audiences by offering experiences free of ads and in-app purchases. Since launching last September, Play Pass has added over 200 new titles to the catalog, from puzzles and racing games to utility and kid-friendly apps. We\u2019re also excited to celebrate the world premieres of Super Glitch Dash and Element this week as the newest \u201cPremiering on Play Pass\u201d titles.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      The expanded catalog has  enabled rich user experiences and provided a sustainable stream of revenue for developers using an innovative revenue payout model. In aggregate, titles on Play Pass earn more than 2.5x the revenue compared to their Play Store-only earnings in the US.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Last month, we made Google Play Pass available in <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-play/google-play-pass-new-apps-games-plans-and-availability/\">nine new markets</a> and gave users the option to get started with either an annual subscription or the existing monthly plan. <strong>Today, we are announcing that developers with in-app subscriptions can now nominate their titles to join Play Pass.</strong> If you\u2019re building a great experience that Google Play Pass users would love, you can <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/play-pass\">learn more</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmL0YkKrklqZHTcb6sVZLnSXA7Tf5TELppa0mx7tAn1x3AJA/viewform\">express interest</a> in participating.\n      </p>\n      <h2><strong>Learning path</strong></h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      If you\u2019re looking for an easy way to pick up the highlights of this week, check out the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-week8-app-distribution-monetization\">app distribution and monetization pathway</a>.

As we put the finishing touches on the new platform, today we\u2019re bringing you Beta 3, our last update in <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/overview#timeline\">this year\u2019s preview cycle</a>. For developers, now is the time to make sure your apps are ready, before we bring the official release to consumers.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      You can get Beta 3 today on Pixel 2, 3, 3a, 4, and 4a devices. Just <a href=\"https://www.google.com/android/beta\">enroll here</a> for an over-the-air update. If you\u2019re already enrolled, you\u2019ll automatically get the update soon. As always, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/feedback.html\">let us know your feedback</a>, and thank you for all of the input you\u2019ve provided so far.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Watch for more information on the official Android 11 release coming soon!\n      </p>\n      <h2><strong>What\u2019s in Beta 3?</strong></h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Today\u2019s update includes a release candidate build of Android 11 for Pixel devices and the Android Emulator. We <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/android-11-beta-2-and-platform-stability.html\">reached platform stability at Beta 2</a>, so all app-facing surfaces and behaviors are final, including SDK and NDK APIs, app-facing system behaviors, and restrictions on non-SDK interfaces. With these and the latest fixes and optimizations, Beta 3 gives you everything you need to complete your testing.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      As we bring Android 11 to final form, we\u2019re also taking this opportunity to update Android with the Exposure Notifications System in mind. Starting in Beta 3, users will be able to run Exposure Notification apps on Android 11 without needing to turn on the device location setting. This is an exception we\u2019re making for the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/covid19/exposurenotifications/\">Exposure Notification System</a> only, given that it has been designed in such a way that apps using it can\u2019t infer device location through Bluetooth scanning. To protect user privacy, all other apps will still be prohibited from performing Bluetooth scanning unless the device location setting is on and the user has granted them location permission. You can read more in our <a href=\"https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/update-exposure-notifications\">Update on Exposure Notifications</a> post.\n      </p>\n      <h2><strong>Get your apps ready for Android 11!</strong></h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      With the official Android 11 release on the way, we\u2019re asking all Android app and game developers to finish your compatibility testing and publish your updates soon. For <strong>SDK, library, tools, and game engine developers</strong>, it\u2019s even more important to release a compatible version right away, since your downstream app and game developers may be blocked until they receive your updates.\n      </p>\n\n\n      <div class=\"separator\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AjoXEXif4qA/X0HLZbW1mFI/AAAAAAAAK1E/wDveXbfCJskP3HhystJii6VEm5LjsNprwCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/android11-compat-flow-full.png\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AjoXEXif4qA/X0HLZbW1mFI/AAAAAAAAK1E/wDveXbfCJskP3HhystJii6VEm5LjsNprwCNcBGAsYHQ/s0/android11-compat-flow-full.png\"></a></div>\n\n\n      <p>\n      As we <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/android-11-beta-2-and-platform-stability.html\">covered in depth at Beta 2</a>, here\u2019s how to test for compatibility with Android 11.\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <p>\n      For testing your current app, read <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes-all\">behavior changes for all apps</a> to identify areas where platform changes might affect your apps. Here are some of the top changes to watch for (these apply regardless of your app\u2019s targetSdkVersion):\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li><strong>One-time permission</strong> - Users can now grant single-use permission to access location, device microphone and camera. Details <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/permissions#one-time\">here</a>.\n\n      </li><li><strong>External storage access</strong> - Apps can no longer access other apps\u2019 files in external storage. Details <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/privacy/storage#other-app-specific-dirs\">here</a>.\n\n      </li><li><strong>Scudo hardened allocator</strong> - Scudo is now the heap memory allocator for native code in apps. Details <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes-all#scudo\">here</a>.\n\n      </li><li><strong>File descriptor sanitizer</strong> - Fdsan is now enabled by default to detect file descriptor handling issues for native code in apps. Details <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes-all#fdsan\">here</a>.\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n      Remember to <strong>test the libraries and SDKs in your app</strong> for compatibility. If you find an issue, try updating to the latest version of the SDK, or reach out to the developer for help.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      For more information on compatibility testing and tools, check out the resources we shared for <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/07/11-weeks-of-android-compatibility.html\">Android 11 Compatibility week</a> and visit the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/11\">Android 11 developer site</a> for technical details.\n      </p>\n      <h2><strong>Explore the new features and APIs</strong></h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Android 11 has a ton of new features to build new experiences for users around people, controls, and privacy. When you\u2019re ready to dive in, check out our <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/unwrapping-android-11-beta-plus-more.html\">#Android11 Beta post</a> for a recap of all of the developer features, and you can also visit the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/android11\">Beta Launch page</a> to see talks from the Android team on what\u2019s new in their areas. For complete details on Android 11 features and APIs, visit the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/11\">Android 11 developer site</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Also make sure to try the Android 11 features in Android Studio that can improve your productivity and workflow, like <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/features#incremental\">ADB incremental</a> for faster installs of large APKs, and additional nullability annotations on platform APIs. You can give these a try by <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/preview\">downloading</a> the latest Android Studio Beta or Canary version. Instructions for configuring Android Studio for Android 11 are <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/setup-sdk\">here</a>.\n      </p>\n      <h2><strong>How do I get Beta 3?</strong></h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      It\u2019s easy! Just <a href=\"https://www.google.com/android/beta\">enroll here</a> to get the Beta 3 update over-the-air on your Pixel 2, 3, 3a, 4, or 4a device. If you're already enrolled, you'll receive the update soon and no action is needed on your part. Alternatively, you can give <a href=\"https://flash.android.com/welcome?continue=%2Fpreview%2Fbeta2\">Android Flash Tool</a> a try for easy on-demand updates, and if you\u2019d rather flash manually, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/download\">downloadable system images</a> are also available. If you don't have a Pixel device, you can use the Android Emulator in Android Studio or try a GSI image to run Android 11 on supported Treble-compliant devices.\n      </p>\n      <h2><strong>What\u2019s next? </strong></h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Stay tuned for the official Android 11 launch coming <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/preview/overview#timeline\">in the weeks ahead</a>!

Millions of reviews are left on Google Play every day, offering developers valuable insight on what users love and what they want improved. Users also rely on ratings and reviews to help them decide which apps and games are right for them.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Over the past two years, Google Play has launched various features to make it easier for users to leave reviews, as well as for developers to interact and respond to them. For example, users are now able to leave reviews from the Google Play homepage. We also launched the Reviews page under My Apps &amp; Games, which gives users a centralized place to leave and manage reviews.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      But one of the most requested features from developers has been to give users the ability to leave a review from within the app, without heading back to the App Details page. So today, we\u2019re pleased to launch the new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review\">in-app review API</a> to address that need.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Ask for a review at just the right time</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      The API lets developers choose when to prompt users to write reviews within the app experience. We believe the best time to prompt your users is when they have used the app enough to be able to provide thorough and useful feedback. However, be sure not to interrupt them in the middle of a task or when their attention is needed, as the review flow will take over the action on the screen.\n      </p>\n      <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MSM5VeZfLAU/Xym0OR_huqI/AAAAAAAAPaA/2u9CsMLiQoE4cx3fmQPf0coIH0TuTWiSwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image2.jpg\"><img alt=\"User ratings for app image\" border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MSM5VeZfLAU/Xym0OR_huqI/AAAAAAAAPaA/2u9CsMLiQoE4cx3fmQPf0coIH0TuTWiSwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/image2.jpg\"></a>\n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">\n      <em>Users can now give ratings and reviews within your app.</em>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      The in-app review API supports both public and private reviews for when your app is in beta.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      The review API is part of the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore\">Play Core Library</a>, which is distributed for <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review/kotlin-java\">Java/Kotlin</a>, <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review/native\">C++</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/in-app-review/unity\">Unity</a>.

Over 600,000 apps and games currently use the app bundle in production, representing over 40% of all releases on Google Play. App bundles are used by 50% of the top developers on Google Play \u2014 such as Adobe, which used app bundles to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/adobe-app-bundle\">reduce the size of Adobe Acrobat Reader by 20%</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We recently launched <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/asset-delivery\">Play Asset Delivery</a> (PAD), bringing the great benefits of app bundles to games and allowing developers to improve the user experience while cutting delivery costs and reducing the size of their games. <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/games/gameloft-pad\">Gameloft</a> used PAD to improve user retention, resulting in 10% more new players than with their previous asset delivery system.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      For those of you making the switch, we\u2019ve published some <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/answers-to-common-questions-about-app-signing-by-google-play-b28fef836af0\">FAQs on Play App Signing</a> \u2014 required for app bundles \u2014 as well as guidance on <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/test\">how to test your app bundle</a>. Read on to find out more about the recent improvements we\u2019ve made to developing, testing, and publishing with app bundles.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Play Feature Delivery</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      The app bundle enables <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/dynamic-delivery#modularize\">modular app development</a> using dynamic feature modules with a range of customizable delivery options. It\u2019s now possible to <strong>shrink resources </strong>in dynamic feature modules as well as your base module when building modular apps. This long-requested feature can result in significantly greater size reduction of your apps. The feature is available from Android Studio 4.2, currently in Canary, under the experimental flag: <code>android.experimental.enableNewResourceShrinker=true</code>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      By default, <strong>install time modules are now automatically fused</strong> when app bundles are processed into distribution APKs (starting in bundletool 1.0.0). This means you can separate your app into modules during development while reducing the number of APKs distributed to each device, which will speed up your app\u2019s download and installation. You can choose to set a \u201cremovable flag\u201d for install-time modules to prevent fusing, which allows you to uninstall a module on the device after it\u2019s been used. It\u2019s a good idea to remove large modules once they\u2019re no longer needed \u2014 reducing the size of your app can make it less likely to be uninstalled.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Feature-to-feature dependency</strong> is now stable in <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/05/android-studio-4.html\">Android Studio 4.0</a>, so you can specify that a dynamic feature module depends on another feature module. Being able to define this relationship ensures that your app has the required modules to unlock additional functionality, resulting in fewer requests and easier modularization of your app.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We know that it is critical for you to <strong>test your app delivery</strong> and get the same experience as your users would in the wild. <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9303479?hl=en\">Internal app sharing</a> lets you upload test builds to Play and get a sharable link to download your app. When downloading your app from this link, you get an identical binary as would be served to users once your app is released to Play.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Play Asset Delivery</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Play Asset Delivery extends the app bundle format, allowing you to package <strong>up to 2GB of game assets</strong> alongside the binary in a single artifact published on Google Play. PAD lets games larger than 150MB replace the legacy expansion files (OBBs) and rely on Play to keep assets up to date, just like you do with your game binary. It also takes care of compression and delta patching, minimizing the size of the download and getting your game to update faster.\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P6faKNdBFNc/XyljSFTlFEI/AAAAAAAAPZo/AouepxZ0xFwORt5NxNAMdsLryC3ZyOMZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Android%2BApp%2BBundle%2B.png\"><img alt=\"Google\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P6faKNdBFNc/XyljSFTlFEI/AAAAAAAAPZo/AouepxZ0xFwORt5NxNAMdsLryC3ZyOMZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Android%2BApp%2BBundle%2B.png\"></a> \n\n       <p>  The contents of an Android App Bundle with one base module, two dynamic feature modules, and two asset packs.</p> \n\n      <p>\n      You can then choose one of three delivery modes, depending on when you want those assets to be served to users: <strong>install-time</strong>, as part of the initial game installation; <strong>on-demand</strong>, so assets will be delivered only upon request; or <strong>fast-follow</strong>, which will trigger an additional download immediately after the game installation completes, independently of the user opening the app. Fast-follow lets you minimize time to first interaction while getting assets to users as quickly as possible.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      In the coming months, we\u2019ll release <strong>texture compression format targeting</strong>, which will allow you to include multiple texture compression format assets and rely on us to deliver them to the most advanced format supported by the requesting device.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Learn more in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW9GevpEo1s&amp;t=2s\">session</a> from our Game Developer Summit and check out the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/asset-delivery\">documentation</a> to see integration options for Unity, Unreal Engine, Gradle, Native, and Java support.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Google Play\u2019s best-in-class distribution</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Google Play delivers billions of apps, games, updates, and dynamic feature modules every month to Android users on thousands of device types around the world. We invest a lot of time and energy into making sure your content is delivered to users as seamlessly and efficiently as possible while hiding the complexity from the user experience.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      For example, we recently <strong>upgraded the download service</strong> Google Play uses. This change alone has sped up the installation of app bundle apps by an average of 6% and increased install success globally by 1%, resulting in millions more new installs for developers every week.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We\u2019re also rolling out multiple <strong>improvements to dynamic feature module distribution</strong>, such as allowing them to be installed when your app is <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager.RunningAppProcessInfo#IMPORTANCE_VISIBLE\">VISIBLE</a> or higher, lowering the free storage threshold that triggers insufficient storage errors, and removing user confirmation for large dynamic features over Wi-Fi. This alone has resulted in 12% more successful deferred module downloads. Apps using dynamic features will benefit from these changes automatically.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <strong>Requirement for new apps in the second half of 2021</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We\u2019re continuing to make app bundles a better publishing format than APKs on Google Play. For example, the new <strong><a href=\"https://play.google.com/console/about/app-bundle-explorer/\">app bundle explorer</a></strong> lets you manage all your app bundles in one place. You can download and attest the exact APKs that Play generates for delivery, as well as a signed, universal APK (a single, installable APK that includes all code and resources needed for supported devices) that you can use on other distribution channels.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We\u2019ve been thrilled to see the app bundle embraced by the app and game ecosystem, and we\u2019re excited to continue to improve it. As we <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMr-b660Esw\">announced</a> in the Android 11 event, to help us invest in future improvements, we intend to <strong>require new apps and games to publish with the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/platform/technology/app-bundle\">Android App Bundle</a> on Google Play in the second half of 2021</strong>. In the same timeframe, we will deprecate legacy APK expansion files (OBBs), making <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/asset-delivery\">Play Asset Delivery</a> the standard option for publishing games over 150MB. We will also require instant experiences to be published via <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/google-play-instant/getting-started/instant-enabled-app-bundle\">instant-enabled app bundles</a>, deprecating the legacy instant app ZIP format.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Thank you to everyone who has already made the switch to the Android App Bundle, and a special thanks to those of you who\u2019ve shared your feedback. Your comments help us shape the future of app bundles and improve the technology for everyone, so please continue to let us know what you think.\n      </p>\n      \n\n      \n      <p>\n      How useful did you find this blog post?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <a href=\"\">\u2605</a> <a href=\"\">\u2605</a> <a href=\"\">\u2605</a> <a href=\"\">\u2605</a> <a href=\"\">\u2605</a>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1LBva3U1LCI/W6kL2pl9ZYI/AAAAAAAAFys/grkBZRKkAWE1eLAh6DPffThJ7gP__SREACLcBGAs/s1600/play_logo_16_9%2B%25285%2529.png\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgHalf\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1LBva3U1LCI/W6kL2pl9ZYI/AAAAAAAAFys/grkBZRKkAWE1eLAh6DPffThJ7gP__SREACLcBGAs/s1600/play_logo_16_9%2B%25285%2529.png\"></a>\n      </p>\n      <div class=\"feedflare\">\n      <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=o5r3Fxrh4j4:SurehLBjoKc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=o5r3Fxrh4j4:SurehLBjoKc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=o5r3Fxrh4j4:SurehLBjoKc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"></a>\n      </div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/o5r3Fxrh4j4\" width=\"1\"></div>",

The <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/06/introducing-new-google-play-console-beta.html\">new Google Play Console beta</a>, available now at <a href=\"https://play.google.com/console\">play.google.com/console</a>, offers customized, secure access to everyone on your team. For a closer look at some of its new features and workflows, tune in to this week\u2019s <a href=\"https://goo.gle/play-console-webinars\">series of live webinars</a>, which will also be available on demand. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/console/about/teamandusermanagement/\"> </a></p>\n\n      <p> Granting your team members safe access to specific features in your developer account is one of the best ways to increase the value of our tools for your organization. We want to make sure that your developer account is as safe as possible so you feel confident when granting access. A key way to do that is to make sure that every person who has access to your account signs in using secure methods that follow best practices. That\u2019s why, towards the end of this year, we\u2019re going to start requiring users of Google Play Console to sign in using <strong><a href=\"https://www.google.com/landing/2step/#tab=why-you-need-it\">Google's 2-Step Verification</a></strong>.</p><p>\n\n\n      </p> <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--mokNZ-heNA/Xygm9YcQ1gI/AAAAAAAAPYY/-WosPHA24aEUZRdG28TZhYkdoDatU1haACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Play%2BConsole%2BImage.png\"><img alt=\"Google\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--mokNZ-heNA/Xygm9YcQ1gI/AAAAAAAAPYY/-WosPHA24aEUZRdG28TZhYkdoDatU1haACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Play%2BConsole%2BImage.png\"></a> \n\n      \n      <p>\n      2-Step Verification uses both your password and a second way to identify you for added security. This could be a text message to a registered phone, an authenticator app, alerts on supported devices, or a hardware security key. Normally, you only have to do this when you sign in for the first time on a new computer. It\u2019s one of the easiest ways to increase the level of security for you and your team members\u2019 accounts.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <a href=\"https://www.google.com/landing/2step/\">Learn more about 2-Step Verification here</a>, and <a href=\"https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839\">how to set it up for your own account</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      If you have any comments or concerns about using 2-Step Verification to sign in to Google Play Console, or if you think it will impact you or your teams\u2019 use of Google Play Console, <a href=\"https://forms.gle/mgxiuYcBGZEpvgt49\">use this form to let us know</a>. All responses will be read by our product team and will help us shape our future plans.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Your team won\u2019t be required to use 2-Step Verification immediately, although we recommend that you <a href=\"https://myaccount.google.com/security/signinoptions/two-step-verification/enroll-welcome\">set it up now</a>. We will start mandating 2-Step Verification with new users to Google Play Console towards the end of Q3, followed by existing users with high-risk permissions like app publishing or changing the prices in in-app products, later in the year. We\u2019ll also remind every impacted user in Google Play Console at least 30 days before the change takes effect. We may also start to re-verify when you\u2019re undertaking a sensitive action like changing your developer name or transferring ownership of an app.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Hundreds of thousands of Google Play Console users already use 2-Step Verification to keep their accounts safe, and it's been the default for G Suite customers for years. But we understand that requiring this may impact some of your existing workflows, which is why we\u2019re giving advance notice of this change and asking for your <a href=\"https://forms.gle/mgxiuYcBGZEpvgt49\">feedback</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We can all take steps to keep our accounts and the developer community safe.

However, we also heard that adding complex animation to Android apps has been a difficult task.To address this problem, we created a powerful set of APIs with Motion Layout and a corresponding tool \u2013 Motion Editor, that when combined make it easier to build pixel-perfect animations. This blog is a quick tour of the new Motion Editor and how to use the latest features during your animation development. Additionally today, you can now watch a new video series specifically created to teach you about the various APIs included with MotionLayout. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/o8c1RO3WgBA\">Watch here</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Motion Editor is a visual design editor for the MotionLayout layout type, making it easier to create and preview animations.

From there, you can edit your layout and Motion Scene files using the familiar interactive tools of the Layout Editor as well as preview your animations right from the Android Studio preview pane.</p>\n      <h2>Motion Editor</h2>\n      <p>\n      The Motion Editor is broken up into several panels which we will describe in this article. The main panels are: <strong>Overview, Selection, Attribute, </strong>and <strong>Preview</strong>.\n      </p>\n      <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OHB4Yt-SbDA/XxtnmCc8YuI/AAAAAAAAPUs/2_1T6zWdtkklT_5V6odsBhqSA2RXXhGpwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fourmainpanels.png\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OHB4Yt-SbDA/XxtnmCc8YuI/AAAAAAAAPUs/2_1T6zWdtkklT_5V6odsBhqSA2RXXhGpwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/fourmainpanels.png\"></a>\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">The Motion Editor has four main panels</p>\n      \n      <h2>Overview panel</h2>\n      MotionLayout helps you animate layout changes, which you specify as transitions between <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintSet\">ConstraintSets</a>. The Motion Editor helps you visualize these states with the Overview panel. To edit constraints in a ConstraintSet, click on the corresponding box in the Overview panel.\n      <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d0JkLjMKWw8/Xxto0v2d7sI/AAAAAAAAPU4/lajvEO3BptcbAswpJ0v7OLJXQdIrH60JQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/twoconstraintsets.gif\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgHalf\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-d0JkLjMKWw8/Xxto0v2d7sI/AAAAAAAAPU4/lajvEO3BptcbAswpJ0v7OLJXQdIrH60JQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/twoconstraintsets.gif\"></a>\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">MotionLayout Scene with two ConstraintSets, start and end, and a Transition between them</p>\n      \n      <h2>Selection panel</h2>\n      <p>\n      The Selection panel provides detailed controls based on the state of the Overview panel. It has three modes:\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n      <li>Motion Layout selected\n      </li><li>ConstraintSet selected\n      </li><li>Transition selected\n      </li>\n      </ol>\n      <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8cJHzjIqoHI/XxtpOYRmO0I/AAAAAAAAPVA/hFz_RUjTnww6Z-4L1sny8M5Jbq0RQgHFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/selectionpanelthreemodes.png\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgHalf\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8cJHzjIqoHI/XxtpOYRmO0I/AAAAAAAAPVA/hFz_RUjTnww6Z-4L1sny8M5Jbq0RQgHFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/selectionpanelthreemodes.png\"></a>\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">The selection panel has three modes depending on the state of the Overview panel</p>\n      <h3>MotionLayout selected</h3>\n      The Motion Editor supports editing of the base <b>Motion Layout</b>.

To do this, MotionLayout uses keyframes. We build keyframe editing into the editor to make it easy to tweak animations. To create a new keyframe, click on the new keyframe icon in the top right of the selection panel. This action opens a dialog where you can set attributes for the keyframe. To edit a keyframe, click on the diamond \u25c6 icon to open the KeyFrame attribute panel.\n      <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tZxKqvnG1ec/XxttBBGJ5LI/AAAAAAAAPVo/dXgEks0RwZEbqisstvreqoWYadEWVMysgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/createkeyframes.png\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgHalf\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tZxKqvnG1ec/XxttBBGJ5LI/AAAAAAAAPVo/dXgEks0RwZEbqisstvreqoWYadEWVMysgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/createkeyframes.png\"></a>\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">Create keyframes with the selection panel</p>\n      \n      <h2>Attribute panel</h2>\n      Creating animations in MotionLayout involves editing lots of view parameters, so we brought the Attribute panel from the Layout Editor into the Motion Editor. The Attribute panel includes handy visualizations for Constraints as well as all the attributes set on each view in the Motion Scene file. \n      <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--zOHy3xOeRs/Xxtts0EDCQI/AAAAAAAAPVw/TJqWI_T_hEAlY4aUyi2ooltLDhWBq9rrgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/constraintvisualization.png\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgHalf\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--zOHy3xOeRs/Xxtts0EDCQI/AAAAAAAAPVw/TJqWI_T_hEAlY4aUyi2ooltLDhWBq9rrgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/constraintvisualization.png\"></a>\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\">Constraint visualization in the Attribute panel</p>\n      The Attribute panel is also where you can create custom attributes. You use custom attributes when you want to animate view properties that are not part of the ConstraintLayout or MotionLayout APIs, such as backgroundColor. We made it easy to create custom attributes with autocomplete and input validation for all view properties.\n      <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BGhNftkvSl4/Xxtu6ZwlbtI/AAAAAAAAPV8/SPXrGihDqjUD4vCoLQX0A-ExVndwI6biwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/customattributes.png\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BGhNftkvSl4/Xxtu6ZwlbtI/AAAAAAAAPV8/SPXrGihDqjUD4vCoLQX0A-ExVndwI6biwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/customattributes.png\"></a>\n      <h2>Preview panel</h2>\n      <p>We wanted to make it easy to quickly edit and get immediate feedback when working on animations, so you can view animations right from the Preview panel. Now you don\u2019t have to recompile and redeploy your app every time you want to make a small tweak to your animation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      We also added a number of features to the Preview panel to make it easier to understand how views are animating. You can preview animations with the Design view and Blueprint view to get a clearer idea of how your views are moving with fewer visual distractions.\n      </p>\n      <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8navaxj0TLo/XxtvFZPZNdI/AAAAAAAAPWA/mEmBHG_R_ZguSmoMU9BgPNJ_hDRNIWwfgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/previewpanel.gif\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgFull\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8navaxj0TLo/XxtvFZPZNdI/AAAAAAAAPWA/mEmBHG_R_ZguSmoMU9BgPNJ_hDRNIWwfgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/previewpanel.gif\"></a>\n      \n      We also added visualizations for the paths views take across the screen, including markers for keyframes. We hope these features make it easier to parse complex transitions and simplify the creation experience.\n      \n      <a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VgI0izcaOTs/XxtvOWXi9TI/AAAAAAAAPWI/lhEGlLnpoSscHoRCP7-zmuxTKTzAg-g2QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/previewlines.gif\"><img border=\"0\" id=\"imgHalf\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VgI0izcaOTs/XxtvOWXi9TI/AAAAAAAAPWI/lhEGlLnpoSscHoRCP7-zmuxTKTzAg-g2QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/previewlines.gif\"></a>\n      \n      <p>\n      The Motion Editor is available in Android Studio 4.0, give it a try and let us know what you think!

For each of the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/11weeksofandroid\">#11WeeksOfAndroid</a>, we\u2019re diving into a key area so you don\u2019t miss anything.This week, we spotlighted <strong>Jetpack</strong>; here\u2019s a look at what you should know.</em>\n      </p>\n      <h2>The big news</h2>\n      <p>\n      In 2018, we launched <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack\">Android Jetpack</a> as a suite of libraries to help developers follow best practices, reduce boilerplate code, and write code that works consistently across Android versions and devices. We are excited about the growth we\u2019ve seen and the incredible feedback that developers like you have shared with us. 47% of the top 1000 apps use 2 or more Jetpack libraries, not including core libraries like AppCompat or Lifecycle. Our work over the past year has been about making the basics easy for Android developers, so that you can focus on the code you care about. We have released many updates to our existing libraries as well as new libraries to help make building high-quality apps easier.\n      </p>\n      <h2>What to watch</h2>\n      <p>\n      We have also been busy pushing out many updates over the past year!\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      For an overall look at what\u2019s new in Jetpack, be sure to check out our talk from #Android11 Beta launch:\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      It\u2019s a quick fly-by introducing many of the updates to our libraries, with pointers on how to get started.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      This week, we\u2019ve also done deep dives into major releases like Hilt, including <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/hilt-and-dagger-annotations-cheat-sheet-9adea070e495\">cheat sheets</a> to help you get started, and how we migrated our own samples to use Hilt for dependency injection. Less boilerplate = more fun.\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      Paging 3.0 is one of our first libraries written Kotlin-first and based on coroutines. The Paging library adds the features you asked for like better error handling, easier list transformations like map or filter, and support for common features like list separators, headers, and footers. We added RxJava, LiveData and ListenableFutures support and backwards compatibility with Paging 2, so it\u2019s easier to migrate.\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      Using the Camera in your app? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYkTXJ2TuiA&amp;feature=emb_title\">CameraX</a> is in Beta and helps developers manage edge cases across different devices and OS versions, so that you don\u2019t have to.\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      This year, we've made several major improvements with the release of Navigation 2.3, which allows you to navigate between different screens of your app with ease while also allowing you to follow Android UI principles. Let us <i>navigate</i> you through them all here:</p>\n      \n      <h2>Spotlight on <i>Permissions</i></h2>\n      <p>\n      In Android 11, we continued our work to give users even more control over sensitive permissions. At the same time, it's very important to us that we make it as easy as possible for you as developers to build for Android. With the changes in privacy over the past several releases, Android Jetpack is making it easier for your app to work with Permissions. Now there are type-safe contracts for common intents and more via new <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result\">ActivityResult</a></code> APIs. These changes simplify how you request permissions, and we\u2019ll continue to work on making permissions easier in the future. Find out more in this post.</p>\n\n      <h2>Learning path</h2>\n      <p>\n      Take a look at our new  <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-week6-jetpack?linkId=94749714\">Learning pathway</a> for an easy way to go through all the highlights from this week. It\u2019s an ordered tutorial which guides you through our new content, culminating in a quiz. Bonus: You earn a bright and shiny Jetpack badge to be saved to your <a href=\"http://google.dev/u/me\">Google Developer Profile</a>. In addition to the learning pathway, we\u2019ve also got a new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/explorer\">library explorer</a> to make it simple to find more about Jetpack libraries you might be looking for and their latest updates.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Key takeaways</h2>\n      <p>Best practices are baked into Jetpack libraries, giving opinionated guidance to make it easier for you to build a higher-quality Android app. We\u2019ve released new features to Navigation and Workmanager, updates to increase the stability of CameraX, added robustness for Biometrics, and more. We\u2019ve also launched new libraries, like our collaboration with Dagger for Hilt and a new library to help improve app startup. Your feedback is important to us; so give these libraries a shot, tell us what you think, and help us improve them!\n      </p>\n      <h2>Resources</h2>\n      <p>\n      <em>You can find the entire playlist of #11WeeksOfAndroid video content <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/androiddevelopers\">here</a>, and learn more about each week <a href=\"http://d.android.com/android11\">here</a>.

Users expect apps to be responsive and fast to load. When an application does not meet this expectation, it can be disappointing to users. This poor experience may cause a user to rate your app badly on the Play store, or even abandon your app altogether.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/app-startup\">Jetpack App Startup</a> is a library that provides a straightforward, performant way to initialize components at application startup. Both library developers and app developers can use App Startup to streamline startup sequences and explicitly set the order of initialization.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Apps and libraries often rely on having components (<code>WorkManager</code>, <code>ProcessLifecycleObserver</code>, <code>FirebaseApp</code> etc.) initialized before <code>Application.onCreate()</code>. This is usually achieved by using content providers to initialize each dependency. Instead of defining separate content providers for each component that needs to be initialized, App Startup lets you define initializers that share a single content provider. This significantly improves app startup time, usually by ~2ms per content provider. App Startup also helps you <strong>further improve startup performance</strong> by making it really easy to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/app-startup#disable-individual\">initialize components lazily</a>. When App Startup goes stable, we will be updating our libraries like `WorkManager` and `ProcessLifecycle` to benefit from this as well.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      App Startup supports API level 14 and above.\n      </p>\n      <h2>How to use it</h2>\n\n\n      <b>Gradle setup</b>\n\n\n      <p>\n      To use App Startup in your library or app, add the following dependency to your gradle file:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">repositories {\n      google()\n      maven()\n      }\n\n      dependencies {\n      implementation \"androidx.startup:startup-runtime:1.0.0-alpha02\"\n      }\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <b>Define an Initializer</b>\n\n\n      <p>\n      To be able to use App Startup in your application, you need to define an<a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/app-startup#implement-initializers\"> Initializer</a>. This is where you define how to initialize and specify your dependencies. Here\u2019s the interface you need to implement:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">interface Initializer&lt;out T: Any&gt; {\n      fun create(context: Context): T\n      fun dependencies(): List&lt;Class&lt;out Initializer&lt;*&gt;&gt;&gt;\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      As a practical example, here\u2019s what an <code>Initializer</code> that initializes <strong>WorkManager</strong> might look like:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">class WorkManagerInitializer : Initializer&lt;WorkManager&gt; {\n      override fun create(context: Context): WorkManager {\n      val configuration = Configuration.Builder()\n      .setMinimumLoggingLevel(Log.DEBUG)\n      .build()\n\n      WorkManager.initialize(context, configuration)\n      return WorkManager.getInstance(context)\n      }\n\n      // This component does not have any dependencies\n      override fun dependencies() = emptyList&lt;Class&lt;out Initializer&lt;*&gt;&gt;&gt;()\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      <b>Note: </b> <i>This example is purely illustrative. This <code>Initializer</code> should actually be defined by the WorkManager library.</i> </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Lastly, we need to add an entry for <code>WorkManagerInitializer</code> in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;provider\n      android:name=\"androidx.startup.InitializationProvider\"\n      android:authorities=\"${applicationId}.androidx-startup\"\n      android:exported=\"false\"\n      tools:node=\"merge\"&gt;\n      &lt;!-- This entry makes WorkManagerInitializer discoverable. --&gt;\n      &lt;meta-data android:name=\"com.example.WorkManagerInitializer\"\n      android:value=\"androidx.startup\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/provider&gt;</pre>\n\n\n      <h2>How it works</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      App Startup uses a single content provider called <code>InitializationProvider</code>. This content provider discovers initializers by introspecting the <code>&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> entries in the merged <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file. This happens before <code>Application.onCreate()</code>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      After the discovery phase, it subsequently initializes a component after having initialized all its dependencies. Therefore, a component is <strong>only initialized after</strong> all its dependencies have been initialized.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Lazy initialization</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      We highly recommend using lazy initialization to further improve startup performance. To make initialization of a component lazy, you need to do the following:\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Add a <code>tools:node=\"remove\"</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;meta-data&gt;</code> entry for the <code>Initializer</code>. This disables eager initialization.\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;provider\n      android:name=\"androidx.startup.InitializationProvider\"\n      android:authorities=\"${applicationId}.androidx-startup\"\n      android:exported=\"false\"\n      tools:node=\"merge\"&gt;\n      &lt;!-- disables eager initialization --&gt;\n      &lt;meta-data android:name=\"com.example.WorkManagerInitializer\"\n      tools:node=\"remove\" /&gt;\n      &lt;/provider&gt;</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      To lazily initialize <code>WorkManagerInitializer</code> you can then use:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">// This returns an instance of WorkManager\n      AppInitializer.getInstance(context)\n      .initializeComponent(WorkManagerInitializer.class);</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Your app now initializes the component lazily.

We\u2019ve recently released the new <code>ActivityResult</code> APIs to help handle these activity results.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Previously, to get results from started activities, apps needed to implement an <code>onActivityResult() </code>method in their activities and fragments, check which <code>requestCode</code> a result is referring to, verify that the <code>requestCode</code> is OK, and finally inspect its result data or extended data.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      This leads to complicated code, and it doesn\u2019t provide a type-safe interface for expected arguments when sending or receiving data from an activity.\n      </p>\n      <h2>What are the ActivityResult APIs?</h2>\n      <p>\n      The <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/activity/result/package-summary\">ActivityResult APIs</a></code> were added to the Jetpack <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/activity\">activity</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/fragment\">fragment</a></code> libraries, making it easier to get results from activities by providing type-safe contracts. These <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/activity/result/contract/ActivityResultContracts\">contracts</a> define expected input and result types for common actions like taking a picture or requesting a permission, while also providing a way to <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result#custom\">create your own contracts</a>.\n\n      </p><p>\n      The <code>ActivityResult</code> APIs provide components for registering for an activity result, launching a request, and handling its result once it is returned by the system. You can also receive the activity result in a separate class from where the activity is launched and still rely on the type-safe contracts.\n      </p>\n      <h2>How to use it</h2>\n      <p>\n      To demonstrate how to use the <code>ActivityResult</code> APIs, let\u2019s go over an example where we\u2019re opening a document.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      First, you need to add the following dependencies to your gradle file:\n      </p>\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">repositories {\n      google()\n      maven()\n      }\n\n      dependencies {\n      implementation \"androidx.activity:activity:1.2.0-alpha02\"\n      implementation \"androidx.fragment:fragment:1.3.0-alpha02\"\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      You need to register a <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/activity/result/ActivityResultCallback\">callback</a> along with the contract that defines its input and output types.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      In this context, <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/activity/result/contract/ActivityResultContracts.GetContent\">GetContent()</a></code> refers to the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT\">ACTION_GET_DOCUMENT</a></code> intent, and is one of the default contracts already defined in the Activity library. You can find the complete list of contracts <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/activity/result/contract/ActivityResultContracts\">here</a>.\n\n\n\n\n      </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">val getContent = registerForActivityResult(GetContent()) { uri: Uri? -&gt;\n      // Handle the returned Uri\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Now we need to launch our activity using the returned launcher. As you can set a mime type filter when listing the selectable files, <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/activity/result/contract/ActivityResultContracts.GetContent\">GetContent.launch()</a></code> will accept a string as a parameter:\n\n\n\n\n      </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">val getContent = registerForActivityResult(GetContent()) { uri: Uri? -&gt;\n      // Handle the returned Uri\n      }\n\n      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n      // ...\n\n      val selectButton = findViewById&lt;Button&gt;(R.id.select_button)\n\n      selectButton.setOnClickListener {\n      // Pass in the mime type you'd like to allow the user to select\n      // as the input\n      getContent.launch(\"image/*\")\n      }\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Once an image has been selected and you return to your activity, your registered callback will be executed with the expected results.<code> </code>As you saw through the code snippets, ActivityResult brings an easier developer experience when dealing with results from activities.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Start using <code>Activity 1.2.0-alpha02</code> and <code>Fragment 1.3.0-alpha02</code> for a type-safe way to handle your intent results with the new <code>ActivityResult</code> APIs.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Let us know what you think and how we can make it better by providing feedback on the <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/new?component=527362&amp;template=1189829\">issue tracker</a>.\n      </p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n      <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=nNzLFWeLXNI:bzfk1Ospctc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\"></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?a=nNzLFWeLXNI:bzfk1Ospctc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/blogspot/hsDu?i=nNzLFWeLXNI:bzfk1Ospctc:-BTjWOF_DHI\"></a>\n      </div><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/hsDu/~4/nNzLFWeLXNI\" width=\"1\"></div>",

Let\u2019s go over the most important changes, see what problems they solve, and learn how to use them!\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Dynamic Navigation</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      We\u2019ve updated Navigation to simplify adding dynamic feature modules for your application.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Previously, implementing navigation between destinations defined in dynamic feature modules required a lot of work. Before you could navigate to the first dynamic destination, you needed to add the Play Core library and the Split Install API to your app. You also needed to check for and download the dynamic module. Once downloaded, you could then finally navigate to the destination. On top of this, if you wanted to have an on-screen progress bar for the module being downloaded, you needed to implement a <code>SplitInstallManager</code> listener.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      To address this complexity, we created the Dynamic Navigator library. This library extends the functionality of the Jetpack Navigation library to provide seamless installation of on-demand dynamic feature modules when navigating. The library handles all Play Store interaction for you, and it even includes a progress screen that provides the download status of your dynamic module.\n\n      </p> <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oO5hDxQNAJc/XxiUD9LVzhI/AAAAAAAAPSg/PiUNldhIeL0FipRFA2qsG76nHXqhKKF_ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/On%2BDemand%2BSample.png\"><img alt=\"The default UI for showing a progress bar when a user navigates to a dynamic feature for the first time.\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oO5hDxQNAJc/XxiUD9LVzhI/AAAAAAAAPSg/PiUNldhIeL0FipRFA2qsG76nHXqhKKF_ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/On%2BDemand%2BSample.png\"></a> \n\n      \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"> The default UI for showing a progress bar when a user navigates to a dynamic feature for the first time. The app displays this screen as the corresponding module downloads \n      </p><p>\n      To use dynamic navigation, all you need to do is:\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n\n      <li>Change instances of <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/fragment/NavHostFragment.html\">NavHostFragment</a></code> to <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/dynamicfeatures/fragment/DynamicNavHostFragment\">DynamicNavHostFragment</a></code>\n\n      </li><li>Add an <code>app:moduleName</code> attribute to the destinations associated with a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/dynamicfeatures/fragment/DynamicNavHostFragment\">DynamicNavHostFragment</a></code>\n      </li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>\n      For more information on dynamic navigation, see <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-dynamic\">Navigate with dynamic feature modules</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/android/app-bundle-samples/tree/master/DynamicFeatureNavigation\">check out the samples</a>.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>NavBackStackEntry: Unlocked</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      When you navigate from one destination to the next, the previous destination and its latest state is placed on the Navigation back stack. If you return to the previous destination by using <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavController#popBackStack(kotlin.Int,%20kotlin.Boolean)\">navController.popBackBack()</a></code>, the top back stack entry is removed from the back stack with its state still intact and the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavDestination\">NavDestination</a></code> is restored.  The Navigation back stack contains all of the previous destinations that were needed to arrive at the current <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavDestination\">NavDestination</a></code>.\n\n      </p><p>\n      We manage the destinations on the Navigation back stack by encapsulating them into the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/NavBackStackEntry\">NavBackStackEntry</a></code> class. <code>NavBackStackEntry</code> is now public. This means that users can go a level deeper than just <code>NavDestinations</code> and gain access to navigation-specific <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel\">ViewModel</a></code>s,  <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/Lifecycle\">Lifecycle</a></code>s, and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/savedstate/SavedStateRegistry\">SavedStateRegistries</a>. You can now properly scope data sharing or ensure it is destroyed at the appropriate time.\n\n      </p><p>\n      See <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-navigate#back-stack\">Navigation and the back stack</a> for more information.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>NavGraph ViewModels</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Since a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/NavBackStackEntry\">NavBackStackEntry</a></code> is a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModelProvider\">ViewModelProvider</a></code>, you can create a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel\">ViewModel</a></code> to share data between destinations at the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavGraph\">NavGraph</a></code> level. Each parent navigation graph of all <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavDestination\">NavDestinations</a></code> are on the back stack, so your view model can be scoped appropriately:\n\n\n\n\n      </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">val viewModel: MyViewModel by navGraphViewModels(R.id.my_graph)\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      For more information on navGraph scoped view models, see <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-programmatic#share_ui-related_data_between_destinations_with_viewmodel\">Share UI-related data between destinations with ViewModel</a>\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Returning a Result from a destination</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      By combining <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/ViewModel\">ViewModel</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/Lifecycle\">Lifecycle</a></code>, you can share data between two specific destinations. To do this, <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/NavBackStackEntry\">NavBackStackEntry</a></code> provides a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/SavedStateHandle\">SavedStateHandle</a></code>, a key-value map that can be used to store and retrieve data, even across configuration changes. By using the given <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/SavedStateHandle\">SavedStateHandle</a></code>, you can access and pass data between destinations. For example to pass data from destination A to destination B:\n\n      </p><p>\n      In destination A:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n      val navController = findNavController();\n      // We use a String here, but any type that can be put in a Bundle is supported\n      navController.currentBackStackEntry?.savedStateHandle?.getLiveData&lt;String&gt;(\"key\")?.observe(\n      viewLifecycleOwner) { result -&gt;\n      // Do something with the result.\n      }\n      }\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      And in destination B:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">navController.previousBackStackEntry?.savedStateHandle?.set(\"key\", result)\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      See <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-programmatic#returning_a_result\">Returning a result to the previous Destination</a> for more details.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Testing your Navigation Flow</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Previously, the recommended testing solution for Navigation was Mockito. You would create a mock <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavController\">NavController</a></code> and verify that <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavController#navigate(kotlin.Int)\">navigate()</a></code> was called at the appropriate time with the correct parameters. Unfortunately, this solution was not enough to test certain areas of Navigation flow, such as <code><span>ViewModel</span></code> interaction or the Navigation back stack. The Navigation Library now offers a well-integrated solution for these areas with the Navigation Testing library.\n\n      </p><p>\n      The Navigation Testing library adds <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/testing/TestNavHostController\">TestNavHostController</a></code>, which gives access to the Navigation back stack in a test environment. This means that you can now verify the state of the entire back stack. When using the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/testing/TestNavHostController\">TestNavHostController</a></code>, you can set your own <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/LifecycleOwner\">LifecycleOwner</a></code>, <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/LifecycleOwner\">ViewModelStoreOwner</a></code>, and <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/activity/OnBackPressedDispatcher\">OnBackPressDispatcher</a></code> by using the APIs given by <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavHostController.html\">NavHostController</a></code>. By setting these components, you can test them in the context of navigation.\n\n      </p><p>\n      For example, here's how to test a destination that uses a nav graph-scoped <code>ViewModel</code>:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val navController = TestNavHostController(ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext())\n\n      // This allows fragments to use by navGraphViewModels()\n      navController.setViewModelStore(ViewModelStore())\n      navController.setGraph(R.navigation.main_nav)\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      The <code>TestNavHostController</code> also lets you set the current destination. You can move the test directly to the use case being tested without the need to set it up using <code>navigate()</code> calls. This is extremely convenient for writing tests for different navigation scenarios.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      When setting the current destination, you might do something like the following:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val navController = TestNavHostController(ApplicationProvider.getApplicationContext())\n\n      navController.setGraph(R.navigation.main_nav)\n      navController.setCurrentDestination(R.id.destination_1)\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Remember that when setting the current destination, that destination must be part of your nav graph.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      For more information about <code>TestNavHostController</code>, see the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-testing\">Test Navigation docs</a>.\n      </p>\n\n      <h2>Nav Deep Linking</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Deep linking allows you to navigate directly to any destination no matter where you currently are in the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/navigation/NavGraph\">NavGraph</a></code>. This can be very useful for launching your app to a specific destination or jumping between destinations that would otherwise be inaccessible to one another.\n\n      </p><p>\n      When navigating using a deep link, you can now provide deep link query parameters in any order and even leave them out altogether if they have been given a default value or have been made nullable. This means that if you have provided default values for all of the query parameters on a deep link, the deep link can match a URL pattern without including any query parameters.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      For example,<code> <strong>www.example.com?arg1={arg1}&amp;arg2={arg2}</strong></code> will now match with <strong><code>www.example.com</code></strong> as long as <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code> have default values and/or are nullable.\n\n      </p><p>\n      Deep links can also be matched using intent actions and MIME types. Instead of requiring destinations to match by URI, you can provide the deep link with an action or MIME type and match with that instead. You can specify multiple match types for a single deep link, but note that <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/java/net/URI?hl=en\">URI</a></code> argument matching is prioritized first, followed by <code>action</code>, and then <code>mimeType</code>.\n\n      </p><p>\n      You create a deep link by adding it to a destination in XML, using the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-kotlin-dsl#deep\">Kotlin DSL</a>, or by using the Navigation Editor in Android Studio.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Here's how to add a deep link to a destination using XML:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">&lt;fragment android:id=\"@+id/a\"\n      android:name=\"com.example.myapplication.FragmentA\"\n      tools:layout=\"@layout/a\"&gt;\n      &lt;deeplink app:url=\"www.example.com\"\n      app:action=\"android.intent.action.MY_ACTION\"\n      app:mimeType=\"type/subtype\"/&gt;\n      &lt;/fragment&gt;\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Here's how to add the same deep link using the Kotlin DSL:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val baseUri = \"http://www.example.com/\"\n\n      fragment&lt;MyFragment&gt;(nav_graph.dest.a) {\n      deepLink(navDeepLink {\n      uriPattern = \"${baseUri}\"\n      action = \"android.intent.action.MY_ACTION\"\n      mimeType = \"type/subtype\"\n      })\n      }\n      </pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      You can also add the same deep link using the Navigation Editor in Android Studio versions 4.1 and higher. Note that you must also be using the Navigation 2.3.0-alpha06 dependency or later.\n\n      </p> <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pdWiqpW1gXw/XxiWRV0uTDI/AAAAAAAAPSs/yXRuANB1Jv4ylvxb3sez-dt44FXQRiVQACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Navigation%2B2020.png\"><img alt=\"An open dialog in the Navigation Editor for adding a deep link to a destination.

You told us that the Paging 2.0 API was not enough - that you wanted easier error handling, more flexibility to implement list transformations like <code>map</code> or <code>filter</code>, and support for list separators, headers, and footers. So we launched Paging 3.0 (now in alpha02), a complete rewrite of the library using Kotlin coroutines (still supporting Java users) and offering the features you asked for.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Paging 3 highlights</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      The Paging 3 API provides support for common functionality that you would otherwise need to implement yourself when loading data in pages:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n\n      <li>Keeps track of the keys to be used for retrieving the next and previous page.\n\n      </li><li>Automatically requests the correct next page when the user scrolls to the end of the loaded data.\n\n      </li><li>Ensures that multiple requests aren\u2019t triggered at the same time.\n\n      </li><li>Tracks loading state and allows you to display it in a <code>RecyclerView</code> list item or elsewhere in your UI, and provides easy retry functionality for failed loads.\n\n      </li><li>Enables common operations like <code>map</code> or <code>filter</code> on the list to be displayed, independently of whether you\u2019re using <code>Flow</code>, <code>LiveData</code>, or RxJava <code>Flowable</code> or <code>Observable</code>.\n\n      </li><li>Provides an easy way of implementing list separators.\n\n      </li><li>Simplifies data caching, ensuring that you\u2019re not executing data transformations at every configuration change.\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>\n      We also made several Paging 3 components backwards compatible with Paging 2.0; so if you already use Paging in your app, you can <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-migration\">migrate</a> incrementally.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Adopting Paging 3 in your app</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Let\u2019s say that we\u2019re implementing an app that displays all the good doggos. We get the doggos from a <code>GoodDoggos</code> API that supports index-based pagination. Let\u2019s go over the Paging components we need to implement and how they fit into your app architecture. The following examples will be in Kotlin, using coroutines. For examples in the Java programming language using LiveData/RxJava, check out the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview\">documentation</a>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      The Paging library integrates directly into the recommended Android app architecture in each layer of your app:\n      </p>\n\n       <a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WDij3mAUZEo/XxXYliprwbI/AAAAAAAAPRY/EaHnaoH0S60ydry-Q7ZPpw1L5FuPG_cnACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2020-07-01%2Bat%2B13.41.47.png\"><img alt=\"Paging components\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WDij3mAUZEo/XxXYliprwbI/AAAAAAAAPRY/EaHnaoH0S60ydry-Q7ZPpw1L5FuPG_cnACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2020-07-01%2Bat%2B13.41.47.png\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Paging components and their integration in the app architecture\" \n\n\n      </p><h3>Defining the data source</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Depending on where you\u2019re loading data from, implement only a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/PagingSource\">PagingSource</a></code> or a <code>PagingSource</code> and a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator\">RemoteMediator</a></code>:\n\n      </p><ul>\n\n      <li>If you\u2019re loading data from a <strong>single source</strong>, like network, local database, a file, etc, implement the <code>PagingSource</code> (if you\u2019re using Room, it <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/accessing-data#paging-integration\">implements</a> the <code>PagingSource</code> for you starting in Room 2.3.0-alpha).\n\n      </li><li>If you\u2019re loading data from a <strong>layered source</strong>, like a network data source with a local database cache, implement the <code>RemoteMediator</code> to merge the two sources and a <code>PagingSource</code> for the local database cache.\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n      <h3>PagingSource</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      A <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/PagingSource\">PagingSource</a></code> defines the source of paging data and how to retrieve data from that single source. The <code>PagingSource</code> should be part of the repository layer. Implement <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/PagingSource#load\">load()</a></code> to retrieve paged data from your data source and return the loaded data together with information about next and previous keys. This is a <code>suspend</code> function, so you can call other <code>suspend</code> functions here, such as the network call:\n\n\n\n\n      </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">class DoggosRemotePagingSource(\n      val backend: GoodDoggosService\n      ) : PagingSource&lt;Int, Dog&gt;() {\n      override suspend fun load(\n      params: LoadParams&lt;Int&gt;\n      ): LoadResult&lt;Int, Dog&gt; {\n      try {\n      // Load page 1 if undefined.\n      val nextPageNumber = params.key ?: 1\n      val response = backend.getDoggos(nextPageNumber)\n      return LoadResult.Page(\n      data = response.doggos,\n      prevKey = null, // Only paging forward.\n      nextKey = response.nextPageNumber + 1\n      )\n      } catch (e: Exception) {\n      // Handle errors in this block\n      return LoadResult.Error(exception)\n      }\n      }\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <h3>PagingData and Pager</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      The container for paginated data is called <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/PagingData\">PagingData</a></code>. A new instance of <code>PagingData</code> is created every time your data is refreshed. To build a stream of <code>PagingData</code> create a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/Pager\">Pager</a></code> instance, using a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/PagingConfig\">PagingConfig</a></code> configuration object and a function that tells the <code>Pager</code> how to get an instance of your <code>PagingSource</code> implementation.\n\n      </p><p>\n      In your <code>ViewModel</code> you construct the <code>Pager</code> object and expose a <code>Flow&lt;PagingData&gt;</code> to the UI. <code>Flow&lt;PagingData&gt;</code> has a handy <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/package-summary#cachedin\">cachedIn()</a></code> method that makes the data stream shareable and allows you to cache the content of a <code>Flow&lt;PagingData&gt;</code> in a <code>CoroutineScope</code>. That way if you implement any transformations on the data stream, they will not be triggered again each time you <code>collect</code> the <code>flow</code> after <code>Activity</code> recreation. The caching should be done as close to the UI layer as possible, but not in the UI layer, as we want to make sure it persists beyond configuration change. The best place for this would be in a <code>ViewModel</code>, using the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/lifecycle/package-summary#viewmodelscope\">viewModelScope</a></code>:\n\n\n\n\n      </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">val doggosPagingFlow = Pager(PagingConfig(pageSize = 10)) {\n      DogRemotePagingSource(goodDoggosService)\n      }.flow.cachedIn(viewModelScope)</pre>\n\n\n      <h3>PagingDataAdapter</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      To connect a <code>RecyclerView</code> to the <code>PagingData</code>, implement a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/PagingDataAdapter\">PagingDataAdapter</a></code>:\n\n\n\n\n      </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">class DogAdapter(diffCallback: DiffUtil.ItemCallback&lt;Dog&gt;) :\n      PagingDataAdapter&lt;Dog, DogViewHolder&gt;(diffCallback) {\n      override fun onCreateViewHolder(\n      parent: ViewGroup,\n      viewType: Int\n      ): DogViewHolder {\n      return DogViewHolder(parent)\n      }\n\n      override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: DogViewHolder, position: Int) {\n      val item = getItem(position)\n      if(item == null) {\n      holder.bindPlaceholder()\n      } else {\n      holder.bind(item)\n      }\n      }\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Then, in your <code>Activity</code>/<code>Fragment</code> you\u2019ll have to collect the <code>Flow&lt;PagingData&gt;</code> and submit it to the <code>PagingDataAdapter</code>. This is what the implementation would look like in an <code>Activity onCreate()</code>:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val viewModel by viewModels&lt;DoggosViewModel&gt;()\n\n      val pagingAdapter = DogAdapter(DogComparator)\n      val recyclerView = findViewById&lt;RecyclerView&gt;(R.id.recycler_view)\n      recyclerView.adapter = pagingAdapter\n\n      lifecycleScope.launch {\n      viewModel.doggosPagingFlow.collectLatest { pagingData -&gt;\n      pagingAdapter.submitData(pagingData)\n      }\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <h2>Paged data transformations</h2>\n\n       <a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-97PVeeAEpNk/XxXah7PeWZI/AAAAAAAAPRs/TaNPCBrtBMkzlbxBJkdv6dJEsbCuwSQ5ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2020-07-19%2Bat%2B12.31.10.png\"><img alt=\"A filtered list\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-97PVeeAEpNk/XxXah7PeWZI/AAAAAAAAPRs/TaNPCBrtBMkzlbxBJkdv6dJEsbCuwSQ5ACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2020-07-19%2Bat%2B12.31.10.png\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"> Displaying a filtered list \n\n      </p><p>\n      Transforming <code>PagingData</code> streams is very similar to the way you would any other data stream. For example, if we only want to display playful doggos from our <code>Flow&lt;PagingData&lt;Dog&gt;&gt;</code> we would need to map the <code>Flow</code> object and then <code>filter</code> the <code>PagingData</code>:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">doggosPagingFlow.map { pagingData -&gt;\n      pagingData.filter { dog -&gt; dog.isPlayful }\n      }</pre>\n\n       <a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BhEPdp1l9P8/XxXbF-Z0F0I/AAAAAAAAPR4/KyDkrVZTmuMFMfRqhIuYf9ifj7x87KE9QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2020-07-19%2Bat%2B12.23.26.png\"><img alt=\"list with separators\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BhEPdp1l9P8/XxXbF-Z0F0I/AAAAAAAAPR4/KyDkrVZTmuMFMfRqhIuYf9ifj7x87KE9QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Screenshot%2B2020-07-19%2Bat%2B12.23.26.png\"></a> \n\n      <p id=\"imgCaption\"> List with separators \n\n      </p><p>\n      Adding <strong>list separators</strong> is also a paged data transformation where we transform the <code>PagingData</code> to insert separator objects into the list. For example, we can insert letter separators for our doggos\u2019 names. When using separators, you will need to implement your own UI model class that supports the new separator items. To modify your <code>PagingData</code> to add separators, you will use the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/PagingData#insertseparators\">insertSeparators</a></code> transformation:\n\n\n\n\n      </p><pre class=\"prettyprint\">pager.flow.map { pagingData: PagingData&lt;Dog&gt; -&gt;\n      pagingData.map { doggo -&gt;\n      // Convert items in stream to UiModel.DogModel.\n      UiModel.DogModel(doggo)\n      }\n      .insertSeparators&lt;UiModel.DogModel, UiModel&gt; { before: Dog, after: Dog -&gt;\n      return if(after == null) {\n      // we're at the end of the list\n      null\n      } else if (before == null || before.breed != after.breed) {\n      // breed above and below different, show separator\n      UiModel.SeparatorItem(after.breed)\n      } else {\n      // no separator\n      null\n      }\n      }\n      }\n      }.cachedIn(viewModelScope)</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Just as before, we're using <code>cachedIn</code> right before the UI layer. This ensures that loaded data and the results of any transformations can be cached and reused after a configuration change.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Advanced Paging work with RemoteMediator</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      If you\u2019re paging data from a <strong>layered source</strong>, you should implement a <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator\">RemoteMediator</a></code>. For example, in the implementation of this class you need to request data from the network and save it in the database. The <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/RemoteMediator#load\">load()</a></code> method will be triggered whenever there is no more data in the database to be displayed. Based on the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/PagingState\">PagingState</a></code> and the <code><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/paging/LoadType\">LoadType</a></code> we can construct the next page request.\n\n      </p><p>\n      It\u2019s your responsibility to define how the previous and next remote page keys are constructed and retained as the Paging library doesn\u2019t know what your API looks like. For example, you can associate remote keys to every item you receive from the network and save them in the database.\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">override suspend fun load(loadType: LoadType, state: PagingState&lt;Int, Dog&gt;): MediatorResult {\n\n      val page = ... // computed based on loadType and state\n\n      try {\n      val doggos = backend.getDoggos(page)\n      doggosDatabase.doggosDao().insertAll(doggos)\n\n      val endOfPaginationReached = emails.isEmpty()\n      return MediatorResult.Success(endOfPaginationReached = endOfPaginationReached)\n      } catch (exception: Exception) {\n      return MediatorResult.Error(exception)\n      }\n      }</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      When you\u2019re loading data from the network and saving it to the database, the database is the source of truth for the data displayed on the screen. This means that the UI will be displaying data from your database, so you\u2019ll have to implement a <code>PagingSource</code> for your database. If you\u2019re using Room, you\u2019ll just need to add a new query in your DAO that returns a <code>PagingSource</code>:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">@Query(\"SELECT * FROM doggos\")\n      fun getDoggos(): PagingSource&lt;Int, Dog&gt;</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      The <code>Pager</code> implementation changes slightly in this case, as you need to pass the <code>RemoteMediator</code> instance as well:\n      </p>\n\n\n\n      <pre class=\"prettyprint\">val pagingSourceFactory = { database.doggosDao().getDoggos() }\n\n      return Pager(\n      config = PagingConfig(pageSize = NETWORK_PAGE_SIZE),\n      remoteMediator = DoggosRemoteMediator(service, database),\n      pagingSourceFactory = pagingSourceFactory\n      ).flow</pre>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Check out the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-network-db\">docs</a> to find out more about working with RemoteMediator.

It makes it easier to work with large sets of data whether it\u2019s being loaded from the network, a database, in-memory cache, or some combination of these sources. The library is built on coroutines and <code>Flow</code>, making it easy to call suspend functions and work with streams of data.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      As Paging 3 is still in alpha, we need your help to make it better!

Each week we\u2019re diving into a key area of Android so you don\u2019t miss anything. This week, we spotlighted <strong>languages</strong>; here\u2019s a look at what you should know.</em>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      Modern Android development starts with outstanding language support. Together, Kotlin, the Java programming language, and C++ form the foundation for Android\u2019s APIs and the tools you use every day for app development. This week we dove into all of the latest news across Android\u2019s three core languages: from Kotlin coroutines to Android 11\u2019s new Java APIs to better tools for native development, there\u2019s a lot packed into the latest release.\n      </p>\n      \n      <h2>Kotlin and coroutines</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Kotlin is at the core of Android\u2019s modern, opinionated APIs. We hear from Android developers around the world that they love Kotlin for how expressive it is, how it helps you write higher quality apps, and how easy it is to start using in your existing Java codebase. More than 70% of the top 1000 apps on the Play Store now use Kotlin, and <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-languages-javascript-now-used-by-12-million-developers-but-kotlin-rises-fastest/\">SlashData</a><sup>TM</sup> announced earlier this year that Kotlin has been the fastest growing language community in percentage terms over the past two years. With the Android 11 beta, we decided to further embrace Kotlin by officially recommending coroutines for asynchronous work on Android.\n      </p>\n      \n      <p>\n      Coroutines make it easy to write, read, and understand async code. The coroutines library is stable and already has deep integration with many of the Jetpack libraries you may be using, including <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/referencing-data\">Room</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/livedata-with-coroutines-and-flow-part-i-reactive-uis-b20f676d25d7\">LiveData</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager\">WorkManager</a>. If you\u2019re new to coroutines, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6manrgTPzyA\">Android \u2764\ufe0f Coroutines: How to Manage Async Tasks in Kotlin</a>, the latest <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-coroutines\">coroutines learning pathway</a>, and our new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines\">coroutines developer guide</a>.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Getting started with Kotlin</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      From Kotlin-first libraries in Android Jetpack to deep integration with the tools in Android Studio, Android is deeply committed to Kotlin \u2014 and there\u2019s never been a better time to start using it. We\u2019ve heard from many of you, though, that convincing your team to adopt Kotlin is not always easy. Even though Kotlin is 100% interoperable with the Java programming language, your teammates might have concerns. Is it worth spending the time learning a new language? How should you prioritize Kotlin against our other product and technology priorities?\n      </p>\n      <p>\n      This week we released a <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/google-home\">new case study</a> from the Google Home team to help answer some of these questions. Over the course of one year, the Google Home team moved all new feature development to Kotlin and found their null pointer exceptions dropped by 33% during the same period. This is consistent with what we\u2019ve heard from Android teams all over the world \u2014 from <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/stories/apps/duolingo-kotlin\">Duolingo</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao9QvtpszOU&amp;vl=en\">Zomato</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roSp-SsBPp4\">Cash App</a> \u2014 Kotlin is delivering value both in the form of productivity and higher app quality for teams large and small. For all our latest case studies and data on Kotlin, check out our new <a href=\"http://d.android.com/kotlin/stories\">Kotlin case studies page</a>.\n      </p>\n      \n\n      <p>\n      For beginners, we announced the launch of our new <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/courses/topics/android-basics-kotlin\">Android Basics in Kotlin</a> course. If you are just learning how to program, Android Basics teaches essential programming concepts like functions and variables and will take you from \u201cHello World\u201d all the way up through building a whole collection of Android apps in Kotlin.\n      </p>\n      <h2>The Java programming language and C++</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      When we announced official support for Kotlin three years ago, we didn\u2019t forget about the large number of Java and C++ Android developers. In the Android 11 release, we sought to keep improving our support for both of these languages. With the Android 11 beta, we upgraded our Java library support with a number of new APIs from OpenJDK 9, 10, and 11. We also unveiled Java library desugaring in Android Studio 4.0, making it easy to use many of these newer Java APIs even on older Android devices \u2014 for those of you who have asked for java.time support on older devices, we\u2019ve heard you loud and clear, and it\u2019s arrived. For all the latest information on how to make use of these newer APIs, check out Murat Yener\u2019s talk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heCvGfOGH0s&amp;feature=emb_title\">Support for newer Java APIs</a>. With Android 11, we also updated the Android runtime to make app startup even faster with <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/improving-app-startup-with-i-o-prefetching-62fbdb9c9020\">I/O prefetching</a>.\n      </p>\n\n      \n      <p>\n      The C++ developer experience continues to get better, too. Android 11 included updates across the native toolchain, including better tools for <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/pgo-for-native-android-applications-1a48a99e95d0\">profile-guided optimization (PGO)</a> and <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/02/native-dependencies-in-android-studio-40.html\">improvements to native dependency management</a> in Android Studio 4.0.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Ever-improving toolchains</h2>\n\n\n      <p>\n      Finally, we continue to focus on improvements to the D8 and R8 compilers in Android Studio. Android Studio comes with built-in support for the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code\">R8 shrinker</a>, which helps you keep your app\u2019s memory footprint small, leading to higher installs and retention among your users. We also recently added support for shrinking Kotlin libraries and apps that use Kotlin reflection with R8. For more information, check out Mads Ager and Morten Krogh-Jespersen\u2019s latest <a href=\"https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/shrinking-kotlin-libraries-and-applications-using-kotlin-reflection-with-r8-6fe0a0e2d115\">Medium post</a>.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Resources</h3>\n\n\n      <p>\n      <em>You can find the entire playlist of #11WeeksOfAndroid video content <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/androiddevelopers\">here</a>, and learn more about each week <a href=\"http://d.android.com/android11\">here</a>.
